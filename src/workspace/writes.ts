// The workspace write layer — every product file write goes through here
// (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: derived-file writes are atomic — temp file +
// rename in the same directory; the workspace layer owns all I/O).
//
// SPEC 13.5: file writes are atomic in their observable effect — at every
// moment, concurrent readers and interrupted commands included, a path xspec
// writes holds either its prior state (the previous content, or absence) or
// the complete new content, never a partial write. Temp-file-plus-rename in
// the target's own directory gives exactly that: the temp file carries the
// complete bytes before the rename, and the rename replaces the target in
// one atomic step.
//
// SPEC 13.4: every file xspec writes is a plain file suitable for
// committing (temp + rename only ever creates regular files; stable
// ordering and sorted keys are the canonical serializer's, core/
// canonical-json.ts). Derived-file paths belong to xspec: writing a derived
// file replaces whatever occupies its path — a symbolic link included,
// which is replaced as itself and never written through. A durable file's
// path occupied by anything other than a plain file is never read, appended
// to, or replaced: the read side reports it (journal → 14.13, session →
// 14.21), and the write primitives here refuse it as a terminal defense.
//
// SPEC 13.4 → 14.22: writes never traverse symbolic links. A symbolic link
// at a workspace-relative directory component of any write path refuses the
// write, reported before anything is modified; `check` reports it without
// writing. `symlinkWritePathFindings` is that report's producer — callers
// (build, and every command that writes) run it over their complete write
// set before touching the workspace, and the write primitives re-check as a
// terminal defense. Path components above the workspace root are
// unrestricted (SPEC 13.4).
