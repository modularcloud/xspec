// The store-backed read fast path (SPEC 13.3).
//
// A read command's answer is a pure function of the workspace bytes
// (SPEC 12.0), and the stored graph data records the derivation inputs it
// was computed from — the configuration file's content hash with its parsed
// form, the journal's content hash, and every discovered source's content
// hash (core/graph-data.ts `StoredInputs`). When every recorded input
// matches the current bytes, the stored snapshot IS what the full pipeline
// would re-derive (SPEC 12.0 determinism), the store already "matches the
// current sources and configuration" (SPEC 13.3 — no refresh would write),
// and the query subcommands can answer from it directly — without loading
// the MDX parser or the TypeScript compiler, which is the point: a fresh
// workspace's `query` costs I/O and hashing, not a re-derivation.
//
// Verification, in order — ANY failure returns null and the caller falls
// back to the full path (cli/commands/query.ts), whose behavior is exactly
// today's; only the positive case answers here, and it is sound:
//
//  1. the store parses as the current versioned shape and its bytes are the
//     canonical serialization of what was parsed (a byte-tampered store
//     must fall back so the full path's compare-and-refresh judges it);
//  2. the configuration file's bytes hash to the recorded configHash, and
//     the recorded parse reconstructs (core/config-data.ts) — identical
//     bytes parse identically (SPEC 12.0), so re-parsing is redundant;
//  3. the journal bytes hash to the recorded journalHash (the journal is a
//     derivation input, SPEC 5.4);
//  4. discovery over the reconstructed configuration — the same walk and
//     classification the pipeline runs (./discovery.ts) — yields no
//     findings, exactly the recorded path set, and every discovered file's
//     bytes hash to the recorded fingerprint (the discovered SET is part
//     of the record: a new matching file is a mismatch);
//  5. no path a `build` would write has an obstructed workspace-relative
//     directory component (SPEC 14.22): a refused write fails `build`'s
//     validations alike (SPEC 13.3), so on such a workspace the gated full
//     path reports the findings instead of answering — and the availability
//     full path (`at`, SPEC 11.2) answers from the current sources without
//     the refresh side effect, which the identical bytes make byte-equal to
//     this store; falling back keeps both surfaces byte-identical to their
//     full paths.
//
// The fast path never writes (a verified store needs no refresh; SPEC
// 13.3's refreshing reads write only when the store does not match), and
// reads never modify anything (SPEC 13.4).
