// Journal storage — the I/O half (SPEC 6.1, 13.4; IMPLEMENTATION
// Architecture: journal storage is workspace-layer I/O).
//
// The journal lives at `.xspec/journal` under the workspace root. It is a
// durable file (SPEC 13.4): written only by `xspec rename` and `xspec move`
// — every other command at most reads it — never regenerated, and never
// modified or deleted by other commands. An absent file is an empty journal
// (SPEC 6.1). A journal path occupied by anything other than a plain file —
// a symbolic link included — is never read, appended to, or replaced: it is
// a journal error (SPEC 13.4 → 14.13).
//
// Parsing, validation, and the canonical-identity walk are the pure core's
// (src/core/journal.ts); this module classifies the occupant and reads
// bytes, and its one write goes through the workspace write layer
// (writes.ts), like every product file write.
