// The pure derivation of what a build writes is the core's
// (src/core/build.ts); this module performs the writes, strictly after the
// caller has validated the workspace (SPEC 12.1: a failed build modifies
// nothing) and the complete write set (SPEC 14.22,
// writes.ts/obstructedWritePathFindings). Every write goes through the
// workspace write layer, so each file is atomic in its observable effect
// (SPEC 13.5) and replaces whatever occupies its path (SPEC 13.4).
