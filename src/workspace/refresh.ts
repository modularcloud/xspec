// Refresh-on-read — the shared pre-answer step of the graph-data-consuming
// commands (SPEC 13.3): `ids`, `show`, `coverage`, `impact`, `review`
// (every subcommand), and `query`.
//
// SPEC 13.3: read results never come from stale data. When graph data is
// missing or does not match the current sources and configuration, these
// commands refresh it — writing exactly what `xspec build` would write,
// except that no TypeScript or Markdown is generated or removed and the
// recorded derived-file paths are left unchanged — before answering. When
// the current sources fail `build` validation, they report the validation
// errors and exit 1 without answering and without modifying anything: a
// failed refresh, like a failed build (SPEC 12.1), leaves every derived
// file and all graph data unmodified.
//
// `check` never uses this step: it never refreshes and reports staleness
// instead (SPEC 13.3, 14.10) — it composes `analyzeWorkspace` and the
// core predicate itself. `build` regenerates rather than refreshes
// (SPEC 12.1). `rename`/`move` carry their own precedence rules (SPEC
// 12.0) and regenerate as `build` does (SPEC 6.4, 6.5).
//
// IMPLEMENTATION (Architecture): this workspace-layer module owns the I/O —
// the analysis pipeline (./pipeline.ts), the store load and the one write
// (./graph-data.ts) — and takes the refresh content and the staleness
// predicate from the pure core (core/graph-data.ts over core/build.ts:
// "what `xspec build` would write" is `computeBuildOutputs`' graph data,
// so refresh and build agree by construction, byte for byte — SPEC 12.0).
