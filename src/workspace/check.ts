// `xspec check`'s staleness verification — the I/O half (SPEC 12.2, 14.10;
// IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: all filesystem access lives in the workspace
// layer).
//
// SPEC 12.2/14.10: `check` verifies that generated files are
// content-identical to what the current sources and configuration generate,
// and that no recorded derived file remains at a path no longer generated;
// each deviation is a 14.10 finding naming the file and instructing
// rebuilding. SPEC 13.3: `check` never refreshes — this module only reads
// and compares, writing nothing; the graph data itself is judged by the
// same compare-with-current predicate the refreshing reads use
// (core/graph-data.ts, `graphDataMatchesCurrent`), so the retained
// derived-file record never reads as staleness.
//
// The comparison is against the pure build derivation (core/build.ts): the
// caller computes the current `BuildOutputs` over a workspace that passed
// build validation — with invalid sources "what the current sources and
// configuration generate" is undefined, and the validation findings mask
// staleness (SPEC 14).
