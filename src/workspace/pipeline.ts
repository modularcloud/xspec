// The workspace analysis pipeline (SPEC 12.1, 13.3, 14) — the shared
// pre-answer step of every command that parses and validates the configured
// sources: `build` runs it before generating, the graph-data consumers run
// it to refresh and to fail on invalid sources (SPEC 13.3), and `check` runs
// it as the base of its validations (SPEC 12.2).
//
// IMPLEMENTATION (Architecture): this workspace-layer module owns the I/O —
// discovery (the walk), reading source bytes, loading the journal — and
// composes the pure core: MDX parsing (core/mdx.ts), import and reference
// analysis (core/spec-references.ts), TypeScript analysis
// (core/code-analysis.ts), graph assembly (core/graph.ts), the text model
// (core/text-model.ts), and the four hashes (core/hashes.ts).
//
// Reporting semantics (SPEC 14): every detectable condition is collected —
// each present condition, not only the first — with the masking rules
// applied where the data flows:
//
// - a discovery-level configuration error (a file matched by both a spec and
//   a code group, SPEC 7.2 → 14.14) precedes all source analysis: it is
//   returned separately as a usage-class error (exit 2, SPEC 12.0) and no
//   source is parsed;
// - an unparseable source (14.20) masks the conditions inside itself: the
//   file contributes its single 14.20 finding and nothing else, and
//   references into it report as unresolved (14.5–14.7) during graph
//   resolution;
// - invalid source paths (14.19) make the file no source: it is skipped with
//   its finding.
//
// The journal is loaded here because it is a validation subject (14.13) and
// a hash input (SPEC 5.4, 5.5): a workspace whose journal is malformed fails
// build validation like any other finding-bearing workspace.
