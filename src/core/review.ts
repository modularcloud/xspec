// The review session model and stored form (SPEC 10.1–10.3).
//
// SPEC 10.1: a review session is stored at `.xspec/reviews/<session-name>.json`
// as a plain, deterministic file — a durable task ledger (13.4), written only
// by the mutating `review` subcommands and never regenerated. A session name
// is one or more characters of `A–Z a–z 0–9 . _ -`, never beginning with `.`;
// names are case-sensitive, with `review create` alone refusing a name that
// matches an existing session's ignoring ASCII case (10.7). A session file
// that is not a plain file, cannot be parsed, or violates a session invariant
// is corrupt (14.21).
//
// Stored document (this implementation's design; SPEC.md fixes the
// information, not the concrete shape) — one canonical-JSON document
// (canonical-json.ts: sorted keys, two-space indentation, trailing newline):
//
//   {
//     "creationParameters": {"base": <commit>} | {} | {"profile": {…}},
//     "decompositions": [{"kind": "subtree-coherence", "scope": <ref>}, …],
//     "items": [<item>, …],
//     "journalLength": <n>,
//     "nextItemId": <n>,
//     "strategy": "path-blocks" | "audit" | "coverage",
//     "version": 1
//   }
//
// where every node reference <ref> is a canonical identity key (identity
// policy below).
//
// and each item carries exactly the fields of SPEC 10.2 — `id`, `kind`,
// `scope`, `context`, `reason`, `origin`, `baseline`, `current`, `status`,
// optional `note`, `blockedBy` — plus the recorded text snapshots
// (`baselineTexts`, `derivedTexts`) that keep items actionable after the
// referenced nodes are edited, moved, or deleted (SPEC 10.2, 10.7: an absent
// node's text is its value in the most recent graph state that contained it,
// among the item's `baseline` state and the states under which mutating
// subcommands derived the item).
//
// Identity policy: every stored node reference — an item's `scope`, its
// `context` and `origin` entries, the node keys of `baseline`/`current` and
// of `baselineTexts`/`derivedTexts`, and each recorded decomposition's
// `scope` — is a canonical identity (SPEC 5.4) in the injective key
// encoding of src/core/journal.ts (`<position>:<identity>`,
// `encodeCanonicalIdentity`). A node's canonical identity never changes as
// the journal grows (SPEC 6.1: append-only), so byte equality of stored
// references IS the canonical comparison SPEC 10.4 requires wherever review
// compares or matches recorded nodes — item matching, decomposition
// matching, and the at-most-one invariant (10.1, 10.5) are checked
// byte-wise here, journal-free. Two canonically distinct nodes may come to
// share one forward-mapped spelling (a spelling vacated by a manual
// deletion, SPEC 6.6, and later recaptured by a journaled rename), which is
// exactly why spellings are never the stored or matching key. Reads derive
// each reference's current spelling — the recorded identity mapped forward
// through the journal (SPEC 10.4, 6.3) — for presentation and graph
// lookups only (src/core/review-state.ts).
//
// `journalLength` records the journal's entry count when the session was
// last written — the write-moment bound: every stored reference's canonical
// position is <= it (positions come from walks over that journal or a
// prefix of it), and parsing enforces the bound as a session invariant. It
// plays no identity-mapping role.
//
// This module is pure (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture): the model, name rules,
// status semantics, parsing, validation, and serialization take bytes and
// values. File I/O — reading `.xspec/reviews/`, classifying occupants,
// writing session files — lives in src/workspace/reviews.ts.
