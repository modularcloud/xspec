// Graph data — the serializable store model (SPEC 13.3).
//
// Pure core (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: serialization is core —
// deterministic, I/O-free; storage I/O is the workspace layer's,
// src/workspace/graph-data.ts): xspec maintains graph data under `.xspec/`,
// containing requirement nodes, code locations, edges by kind, reference
// occurrences (SPEC 5.7), source ranges (SPEC 1.7), all four hashes
// (SPEC 5.5), coverage attributes (SPEC 2.5), tags (SPEC 2.6), and the
// paths of the derived files most recently generated (SPEC 13.3, 13.4).
// This module defines that content:
//
// - the stored model — a plain-data snapshot of the assembled workspace
//   graph (./graph.ts) plus the recorded derived-file paths;
// - `buildGraphSnapshot` — the pure derivation of the snapshot from the
//   graph and its computed hashes (./hashes.ts);
// - `serializeGraphData`/`parseGraphData` — the byte encoding through the
//   one canonical serializer (./canonical-json.ts; IMPLEMENTATION: stored
//   JSON goes through one canonical serializer — sorted keys, stable
//   ordering, trailing newline), byte-deterministic for a given workspace
//   (SPEC 12.0: no wall-clock values, no randomness, no absolute paths —
//   every stored path is workspace-relative, SPEC 1.5);
// - the compare-with-current predicate `graphDataMatchesCurrent` — shared
//   by refresh-on-read (SPEC 13.3) and `check`'s staleness finding
//   (SPEC 14.10), so both judge the store by one rule.
//
// The two parts age differently (SPEC 13.3): the snapshot is a pure
// function of the current sources, configuration, and journal, and
// "graph data does not match the current sources and configuration"
// exactly when the stored bytes differ from a re-serialization holding the
// current snapshot; the recorded derived-file paths are updated only by
// generation (`xspec build`, and the commands that regenerate as `build`
// does) — a refresh leaves them unchanged, and the record legitimately
// outlives the generation set (that is what makes orphan removal and
// 14.10's recorded-orphan arm possible, SPEC 13.3, 13.4, 12.1). A refresh
// writes exactly what `xspec build` would write except for that record
// clause (SPEC 13.3): with a recoverable record, build's data with the
// stored record preserved; with none — the store missing or malformed —
// there are no recorded paths to preserve, and the written data is exactly
// build's, would-be record included. The predicate compares against the
// same refreshed form, so both judge the store by one rule.
//
// The content is otherwise opaque (SPEC 13.3): its observable contract is
// its location under `.xspec/`, its classification as a derived file
// (SPEC 13.4), and the refresh, failure, and staleness behaviors — the
// concrete JSON shape here is an implementation choice, versioned so a
// future shape change reads as "does not match" rather than misparsing.
