// Review-session derivation machinery (SPEC 10.5, 10.7).
//
// Pure core (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: review-session logic is core —
// deterministic, I/O-free): the strategy-generic half of item derivation.
// A strategy generator (src/core/path-blocks.ts for SPEC 10.5; audit and
// coverage per SPEC 10.6/10.7) produces `GeneratedItem` values — the 10.2
// content of each item plus the per-side node identities the state and
// text computations need. This module then:
//
// - replays the session's recorded `split` decompositions over the
//   generated items (SPEC 10.5: a generated item whose kind and scope node
//   are recorded as decomposed is never added back — its decomposition
//   applies instead, recursively), rewriting every blocker reference to a
//   decomposed item into all items of its decomposition;
// - merges the expanded generation into a session's existing items under
//   the re-derivation rules of SPEC 10.5 (`deriveSessionItems`) — the same
//   computation serves `create` (merge into an empty session) and the
//   re-derivation an `updated` resolve triggers;
// - computes each item's recorded `baseline` and `current` states
//   (SPEC 10.2, 10.4) and its text snapshots (SPEC 10.7): `current` via
//   review-state.ts's `computeRecordedState` — byte-identical to what
//   read-time invalidation recomputes, so a freshly derived item is never
//   born invalidated — and `baseline` against the recorded-baseline graph,
//   resolving nodes through their per-side identities so an identity
//   reintroduced by a distinct node (SPEC 5.4) never leaks the wrong
//   side's values;
// - realizes the `split` decomposition (SPEC 10.7,
//   `splitItemDecomposition`) and `resolve`'s status/state update with its
//   `updated`-triggered re-derivation (SPEC 10.5, `resolveSessionItem`);
// - derives the generator-assigned current context sets reads feed to
//   read-time invalidation (SPEC 10.4, `currentContextSets`);
// - orders items per the total order of SPEC 10.5 (`sortItemsPathBlocks`)
//   and per the file-path-then-document order of SPEC 10.6 audit sessions
//   and SPEC 10.7 coverage sessions (`sortItemsByFileThenDocument`), with
//   the shared present-before-absent document-order tie machinery
//   ("wherever an item order ranks by document order — here, in 10.6, and
//   in 10.7", SPEC 10.5).
//
// Identity policy (src/core/review.ts header): the strategy generators
// work in spelling space — a `GeneratedNode.identity` as produced is the
// node's current-graph spelling (a deleted node's baseline identity mapped
// forward through the replay journal, SPEC 6.3) plus its identity in the
// baseline graph (null when absent there). `canonicalizeGeneration` is the
// central seam that rewrites one generator run into canonical-reference
// space (SPEC 5.4): a node identified by a current-graph spelling
// canonicalizes against the full current journal, while a node that exists
// only in the recorded baseline canonicalizes as of the baseline journal
// prefix from its baseline identity — never by canonicalizing its
// forward-mapped spelling against the full journal, which would
// misattribute a spelling recaptured by a replay entry. Everything
// downstream of the seam — matching, decomposition replay, `split`, state
// and text keys — is byte-wise over (kind, canonical scope reference),
// which IS the canonical comparison SPEC 10.4 requires; spellings are
// derived (`spellingOfReference`) only for graph lookups, item ordering,
// and generator content.
