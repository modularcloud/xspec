// The built-in `audit` review strategy (SPEC 10.6).
//
// Pure core (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: review-session logic is core —
// deterministic, I/O-free): over the current workspace graph alone, this
// module generates the items of an `audit` session — one `subtree-coherence`
// item per requirement node, root nodes included, with the node's ancestor
// chain as context, an empty origin, and scope as in 10.5: the node and all
// its descendants (the stored scope is the node, the subtree root). Audit
// requires no baseline and reviews the entire workspace, so its generators
// take no creation parameters (SPEC 10.7: an audit session records none) and
// every generated node enters with no baseline identity — an audit item's
// `baseline` is the current graph's values at the moment it enters the
// session (SPEC 10.2).
//
// Blocking, not order, enforces bottom-up review (SPEC 10.6): each item's
// `blockedBy` is the set of its child sections' items — after a `split`, the
// items of their decompositions, which the decomposition replay's reference
// rewrite realizes (src/core/review-derive.ts `expandDecompositions`) — so
// leaf items are unblocked and subtrees are confirmed bottom-up. Audit's
// item order — scope-node file path first (byte order), then document order
// within the file — is `sortItemsByFileThenDocument` (review-derive.ts).
//
// The generation is consumed exactly like the `path-blocks` one
// (src/core/path-blocks.ts): `create` and the resolve-time re-derivation of
// SPEC 10.5 — which holds for every strategy — replay the recorded
// decompositions over it and merge it into the session, and reads match it
// to items for the current context sets of SPEC 10.4. Because audit
// generates one item per current requirement node, a decomposition's
// per-child items coincide with the main generation's (one builder produces
// both), and the merge's dedup keeps a single item per kind and scope node
// (SPEC 10.1, 10.5).
