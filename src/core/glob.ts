// The glob engine with captures — in-repo per IMPLEMENTATION ("Key
// libraries"): no glob library; the dialect's semantics are pinned exactly
// by the spec and off-the-shelf behavior differs. This is the one glob code
// path: configured group patterns and `--file` flag values compile in
// "plain" mode; policy `files` selectors compile in "capture-from" /
// "capture-to" mode (SPEC 7.5).
//
// SPEC 7: glob matching, like every path comparison (12.0), is byte-wise
// and case-sensitive — workspace-relative paths are matched as their UTF-8
// bytes. Globs support exactly `*` (any possibly empty run of bytes within
// one path segment), `?` (one byte within a segment), and `**` (any number
// of whole segments, including none); every other character is a literal,
// the metacharacters of other dialects (`[` `]` `{` `}` `!` `+` `(` `)`)
// included. Only a whole pattern segment written exactly `**` is the
// whole-segments wildcard; a `**` inside a larger segment reads as two
// adjacent `*` runs. A path segment beginning with `.` is matched only by a
// pattern segment written with a leading `.` — read from the pattern as
// written, so `*`, `?`, `**`, captures, and capture references never match
// a dot-initial segment, and `**` never consumes one. Whether a pattern
// lies outside the workspace root is decided by its spelling alone, a pure
// depth count over its segments ({@link globLiesOutsideRoot}), separate from
// matching. An outside-root configured glob or policy selector is a
// configuration error (14.14); an outside-root `--file` value is the
// flag-level counterpart, a usage error (SPEC 11, 12.0, 12.3) — this module
// only reports the condition as data. Every other pattern is inside the
// root and is matched exactly as spelled: no segment is resolved,
// collapsed, or dropped. SPEC 7: "every other glob is inside, its `.`,
// `..`, and empty segments matching nothing" — a discovered file's
// workspace-relative path is the directory-entry names descending from the
// root, joined with `/`, so it carries no such segment — and SPEC 12.0:
// `./specs/A.mdx` and `specs//A.mdx` "name or match no discovered file".
// Each such segment matches no path segment, and every pattern segment but
// `**` consumes exactly one, so a pattern holding one matches no path at
// all: `./specs/*.mdx`, `specs//*.mdx`, `specs/*.mdx/`, `a/../b/*.mdx`, and
// `specs/**/../*.mdx` match nothing.
//
// SPEC 7.5: a `from` pattern MAY contain capture wildcards `$1`…`$9`, each
// appearing at most once; a capture matches one or more bytes within a
// single path segment (never `/`). The `to` pattern MAY reference them and
// matches only targets whose expansion agrees with the captured values:
// `$n` there matches exactly the captured bytes, as literals — bytes
// captured from a path are never reinterpreted as metacharacters. When a
// pattern could match a path in more than one way, the match is
// disambiguated across the whole pattern, left to right: each wildcard
// (`*`, `?`, `**`) and each capture, in pattern order, takes as few bytes
// as possible while a match of the remainder of the pattern still exists —
// so every match, and every capture value, is unique (`$1-$2.ts` against
// `a-b-c.ts` captures `$1 = a`, `$2 = b-c`; `*$1*` against `abc` captures
// `$1 = a`).
