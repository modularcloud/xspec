// Policy evaluation (SPEC 7.5) — the pure derivation of `xspec check`'s
// policy-violation findings (SPEC 14.12).
//
// SPEC 7.5: named policy rules constrain which dependency edges may exist,
// evaluated over dependency edges of the rule's kinds. A selector matches
// nodes (or code locations) by exactly one of `{ group }` (with a resolved
// spec/code kind), `{ files: <glob> }`, or `{ tags: [...] }` (carrying at
// least one listed tag). In `files` selectors the `from` pattern MAY bind
// capture wildcards `$1`…`$9` and the `to` pattern MAY reference them — a
// `to` containing captures matches only targets whose expansion agrees with
// the captured values (core/glob.ts owns the disambiguation).
//
// Semantics:
// - `forbidden`: any edge whose source matches `from` and whose target
//   matches `to` is a violation.
// - `allowedOnly`: every edge whose source matches `from` MUST have a
//   target matching `to`; each edge that does not is a violation.
//
// Violations are findings reported by `xspec check` — and only `check`:
// `build` does not evaluate policy (SPEC 12.1, 14.12) — each carrying the
// rule name and the offending edge, causing exit 1. Root nodes participate:
// root-sourced and root-targeted dependency edges remain ordinary
// dependency edges for policy (SPEC 8), unlike coverage.
//
// Pure core (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture): a total, deterministic function
// of (configuration, graph) — rules in configuration order, edges in the
// graph's fixed (source, kind, target) order (SPEC 12.0).
