// The built-in `coverage` review strategy (SPEC 10.7).
//
// Pure core (IMPLEMENTATION Architecture: review-session logic is core —
// deterministic, I/O-free): over the current workspace graph and a coverage
// session's recorded profile definition (SPEC 10.7: the named profile's 7.4
// fields, with each group name replaced by that group's configured glob list
// and kind at `create`), this module generates the session's items — one
// `uncovered-requirement` item per uncovered required node of the recorded
// profile: scope the node, context its ancestor chain, origin and
// `blockedBy` empty. Item order — file path, then document order — is
// `sortItemsByFileThenDocument` (review-derive.ts).
//
// Every generator run — `create` and the resolve-time re-derivation of
// SPEC 10.5, which holds for every strategy — uses the recorded parameters:
// the recorded globs are compiled and matched against the currently
// discovered sources (the current graph's nodes), so renaming or editing
// refs, profiles, or groups after `create` never changes what the session
// runs with, while discovery itself follows the current configuration — a
// file that no longer belongs to any configured group contributes no
// current node and is out of the session's view, exactly as if deleted
// (SPEC 10.7). The evaluation itself is the shared resolved-profile seam of
// src/core/coverage.ts (SPEC 8, 8.1), so the coverage command and coverage
// sessions can never disagree about coverage.
//
// A coverage session has no baseline: generated nodes carry no baseline
// identity, and an item's `baseline` is the current graph's values at the
// moment it enters the session (SPEC 10.2).
