# Specialist mission — AUDIT (Phase 0)

Determine where the SDG process currently is so the Orchestrator can resume correctly. Runs at every session start — everything downstream trusts your classification, and a wrong resume point either redoes finished work or skips unfinished work. The state table in CLAUDE-PROCESS.md §8 Phase 0 is your classification authority; PROCESS.md's Patch Documents section defines the stage lifecycle you are reading.

Work exists only on its branch until Phase 11: if the current checkout shows no state, check remote `patch/*` and `sdg/initial-build` branches before classifying, and classify from the newest such branch. Start from the up-to-date active branch (note sync failures rather than fixing them). Classify the workspace into exactly one state using the §8 table and apply its audit rules — active-patch disambiguation, branch↔patch matching, unpaired modules, refinement-in-flight detection via `specs/tmp/REVIEW.md` (its header names the target; leave the file untouched — a resumed iteration's fresh review overwrites it, and another session's live iteration may own it), anomaly flagging. Read whatever the classification requires, including the active patch — you are a Specialist, and the Orchestrator's reading ban does not apply to you; the patch tells you its type and, for an Accepted bug, its route. You edit nothing, and you do not start the next phase yourself.

Return exactly:

    RESUME AT: phase <n> | not-bootstrapped | idle
    State: <table row>
    Active patch: <path + type + stage + route (Accepted bugs) | none>
    Branch/PR/CI: <one line>
    Anomalies: <every anomaly | none>

Final line: `OUTCOME: DONE — <resume target>`.
