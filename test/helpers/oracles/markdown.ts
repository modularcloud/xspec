// In-harness Markdown-compilation oracle (TEST-SPEC 16 P-2, 17 S-6): an
// independent implementation of the removal / replacement / line-drop /
// line-terminator rules of SPEC.md 3 (with the character classes of SPEC.md
// 1.4), used to compute the expected compiled output for the P-2 property
// tests. Per S-6, the oracle passes its fixed vector suite
// (test/self/s6-markdown-oracle.test.ts), derived from SPEC.md 3's examples
// and rules, before any property test trusts it. Harness machinery only:
// pure functions, no product imports, no I/O, no test-framework dependence.
//
// The oracle does not parse MDX. Its callers — the P-2 document generator,
// the S-6 vectors, a CERTIFICATIONS.md CONF-MD fixture sharing this logic —
// construct their documents, so they know exactly where every construct
// sits; the input is the source text segmented into pieces (or the whole
// text plus construct spans, `compileMarkdownSource`). Feeding the oracle
// the caller's own structure rather than a parse of the source is what keeps
// it independent of the product (P-2: "an independent oracle ... the oracle
// lives in the harness").
//
// Grammar boundary (TEST-SPEC T3-1, §16 P-2): constructs exist only where
// the MDX parse yields them — fenced code blocks and inline code spans are
// literal text, so construct-like bytes inside them (`<S id="x">`, `<div>`,
// `import X from "./X.xspec"`, `{text("a")}`) are plain content. Callers
// express that by passing every fence and span byte as a `content` piece;
// the oracle treats content uniformly — preserved verbatim, subject only to
// the drop rule under the 1.4 classes — and never scans content for
// construct-like patterns (the S-6 grammar-boundary vectors pin this).
//
// SPEC.md 3, as implemented here:
//
// * Compilation removes spec module imports, `<S>`/`<Spec>` tags together
//   with their props, and MDX comments (`kind: "removal"`), and replaces
//   each `text(...)` expression with the target's compiled subtree text,
//   fully expanded (`kind: "embedding"` — the caller computes the expansion,
//   expanding chains bottom-up before invoking the oracle). All other
//   Markdown content and author whitespace is preserved.
// * Removal is exact textual deletion of the construct's own characters, in
//   place. A construct whose own characters include a line terminator (a
//   multi-line MDX comment) merges the surrounding lines' residues into one
//   logical line when deleted.
// * A line terminator is U+000D U+000A (one terminator), a U+000A not
//   preceded by U+000D, or a U+000D not followed by U+000A; a line is a
//   maximal terminator-free run plus the terminator that ends it, and the
//   final line may have no terminator. Only terminators in plain content end
//   logical lines: terminators inside a construct's own characters are
//   deleted with the construct, and terminators inside an expansion are
//   inserted bytes of the logical line the expansion landed on, not line
//   breaks of the source document.
// * Drop rule: a logical line that contained non-whitespace (1.4) in the
//   source — surviving residues and deleted construct characters alike — but
//   is left empty or whitespace-only purely by removals (or by a `text(...)`
//   replacement whose expansion is empty) is dropped together with its line
//   terminator, if any. Every other line keeps its remaining content and
//   terminator; in particular, a logical line any non-empty expansion
//   contributed to is never dropped, even when the result is
//   whitespace-only: a non-empty expansion is not a removal, so the line is
//   not left whitespace-only "purely by removals" (TEST-SPEC T3-3's
//   single-space-expansion arm).
// * Whitespace means exactly U+0009, U+000A, U+000B, U+000C, U+000D, and
//   U+0020, and control characters exactly U+0000–U+001F and U+007F; no
//   other code point belongs to either class — U+00A0, U+0085, and U+2028
//   are neither whitespace nor line terminators (SPEC.md 1.4; TEST-SPEC
//   T3-3 class boundaries).
