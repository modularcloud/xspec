// E-6 representative fixture and Linux↔Windows exchange (TEST-SPEC §18 E-6).
// Harness machinery only: no product imports; the product is driven strictly
// as a subprocess through a ProductBinding (H-2, C-2).
//
// One fixture story exercises the E-6 command set — `version`, `build`,
// `check`, `query`, `coverage`, `impact`, `occurrences`, `view --text`,
// `at`, a `move --preview`, a journaled `rename`, a journaled file-form
// `move`, an `audit` review session (`review create --strategy audit`,
// `next --json`, a `resolve`, an `export`), and `inventory` invoked from a
// nested working directory, pinning the relative `/`-joined anchoring (SPEC
// 11.6) — and captures two kinds of output:
//
//   - the transcript: every invocation's argv, exit code, and exact
//     stdout/stderr bytes — the path- and range-dense occurrence, view, at,
//     inventory, and preview documents included (reports, 12.0);
//   - the final workspace tree, `.git/` excluded: move-rewritten sources,
//     generated files, emitted Markdown, graph data, the journal, and the
//     session file (stored data, 1.5/13.4).
//
// The Linux leg (test/suite/e6-exchange-writer.test.ts) runs the fixture
// against the built product and, when XSPEC_E6_EXCHANGE_DIR is set, writes
// both captures into that directory (uploaded as the `e6-linux-outputs` CI
// artifact, .github/workflows/ci.yml). The Windows leg
// (test/windows/e6-byte-identity.test.ts) runs the identical fixture and
// asserts its captures byte-identical to the exchanged ones — a
// product-to-itself comparison, permitted by H-4; byte identity across legs
// is promised because both runs consume byte-identical input (12.0): the
// workspace builder writes declared bytes verbatim (S-2) and the git fixture
// is scripted with pinned, platform-independent commit metadata
// (helpers/workspace.ts), so `impact --base` reads identical baselines on
// both legs.
//
// The `move` is the subset's specifier-computation probe (E-6): it crosses
// directories in both rewrite directions — the moved file's own import
// specifier and two other files' imports of its generated module are
// recomputed (SPEC 6.5), which a native-path-API product writes `\`-separated
// only on Windows — and `check` runs clean after it (T6.4-7). The fixture
// depends on no case-sensitive filesystem, no symlink creation, and no POSIX
// signal semantics, so it stages identically on both legs.
//
// Red-green (H-8): every step asserts its exact exit code through the
// diagnosed-assertion helpers, so against a stub product the fixture fails at
// its first step as a diagnosed assertion failure on either leg — never a
// crash or hang — and the writer writes nothing (the CI artifact upload
// tolerates the empty directory). The Windows-side comparison consults the
// exchange only after its own fixture run succeeded, and a missing or
// malformed exchange is then a loud failure (never a skip or a vacuous pass,
// H-9): with a working product, absent Linux outputs mean broken artifact
// plumbing.
