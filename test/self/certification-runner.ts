// Certification runner (TEST-SPEC 17 preamble, C-1, C-2). Executes the full
// product-facing suite or a named subset — `ProductTestEntry` values resolved
// from the registry (test/suite/registry/index.ts) — against an arbitrary
// fixture product supplied as an executable binding and nothing else (C-2),
// and attributes an outcome to every test ID so certification results are
// legible per fixture, per test, in CI output (C-1; the harness-self job).
// One code path: the runner invokes exactly the registered bodies the Vitest
// suite runs against the built product (test/suite/declare.ts).
//
// Outcome taxonomy (H-8, pinned by helpers/assertions.ts):
//   pass   the body resolved — the product satisfied the test;
//   fail   the body threw `HarnessAssertionError` — a diagnosed assertion
//          failure, the only legitimate way a test rejects a product; this is
//          what C-1's "fails against a violator" and the S-7 sweep's
//          "diagnosed assertion failure" mean;
//   error  the body threw anything else — a harness defect (or an unbuilt
//          fixture), never a certified failure;
//   hang   the body did not settle within its budget — the runner records the
//          hang, leaves the abandoned body observed (a late rejection cannot
//          crash the run), and completes: a hanging test never hangs the
//          runner (H-8).
//
// Determinism (E-5, H-10): results are assembled in selection order — the
// caller's order for named subsets, canonical ID order for the full suite —
// independent of completion order under bounded concurrency (safe by H-1
// workspace isolation), and neither results nor the rendered report carry
// wall-clock data.
