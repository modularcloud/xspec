// Certification of CERTIFICATIONS.md fixtures (TEST-SPEC 17 C-1, C-2).
//
// One per-fixture verification is generated below for every entry of the
// CERTIFICATION_FIXTURES manifest (certification-fixtures.ts) — all five
// conformers and all sixteen violators — and the whole-document gate
// (certification-document.test.ts) proves that manifest equal to
// specs/CERTIFICATIONS.md, so certification demonstrably runs against each
// fixture in the document (C-1).
//
// Each conformer's in-scope tests run against its fixture executable through
// the certification runner (certification-runner.ts) — the identical
// registered bodies the Vitest suite runs against the built product (C-2
// "one code path"). A conformer is verified when every in-scope test passes
// against it; a violator when exactly its certified tests fail against it —
// as diagnosed assertion failures, never harness errors or hangs — and every
// other in-scope test passes (the expected-failure contract of the
// CERTIFICATIONS.md preamble).
//
// The per-fixture report is printed on every run so certification results
// are legible per fixture, per test, in the harness-self CI job output
// (C-1), and the full report accompanies any failure diagnosis.
