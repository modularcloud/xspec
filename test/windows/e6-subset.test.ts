// E-6 platform-sensitive subset, part 1 of 3 (TEST-SPEC §18 E-6; CI-01) —
// the path/identity assertions and the single-casing case-mismatch probes.
// Run by the suite-windows CI job (`npm run test:windows`); the T11.6-1
// drive-mismatch anchoring arm lives in e6-drive-mismatch.test.ts and the
// byte-identity comparison in e6-byte-identity.test.ts.
//
// One code path with the suite leg (C-2):
//
// - T1.5-1, T1.5-3, and T12.0-5 are the registered suite entries themselves,
//   declared here against the built product exactly as test/suite/ declares
//   them. A Linux runner cannot discriminate a product emitting native path
//   separators (`/` is native there); on Windows these same assertions do.
//   T12.0-5's non-UTF-8 arm gates itself to the Linux leg inside the shared
//   body ("less its Linux-leg arm", E-6), so no arm is skipped here — it is
//   simply not part of this platform's staging.
//
// - The four single-casing probes are the exact probe functions the
//   registered bodies call on the suite leg, re-invoked here: each stages one
//   casing and probes another, so the fixture stages identically on any
//   filesystem, and on a case-insensitive one it exposes a product resolving
//   session names (T10.1-2), session file paths (T10.1-3), path arguments
//   (T12.0-6), or glob matches (T7-4) through case-insensitive filesystem
//   lookups. On Linux the case-sensitive filesystem masks such products;
//   here nothing does.
//
// Expected red against the stub product, as diagnosed assertion failures
// (H-8) — on this leg and on any platform this project is run on locally.
