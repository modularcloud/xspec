// E-6 platform-sensitive subset, part 2 of 2 (TEST-SPEC §18 E-6; CI-01) —
// the representative-fixture byte-identity comparison against the Linux leg.
//
// The identical fixture the Linux leg ran (helpers/e6.ts: `version`,
// `build`, `check`, `query`, `coverage`, `impact`, `occurrences`,
// `view --text`, `at`, a `move --preview`, a journaled `rename`, a journaled
// file-form `move` — the specifier-computation probe, with `check` clean
// after it — an `audit` review session, and `inventory` from a nested
// working directory, pinning the relative `/`-joined anchoring) is run here
// against the built product, and its
// outputs are asserted byte-identical to the Linux leg's, read from
// XSPEC_E6_EXCHANGE_DIR (the `e6-linux-outputs` CI artifact,
// .github/workflows/ci.yml): reports (every step's stdout/stderr — the
// path- and range-dense occurrence, view, at, inventory, and preview
// documents included),
// move-rewritten sources, generated files, emitted Markdown, graph data, the
// journal, and the session file — a product-to-itself comparison, permitted
// by H-4, sound because both legs consume byte-identical input (12.0; the
// fixture's git history is scripted with pinned, platform-independent commit
// metadata).
//
// Failure taxonomy (H-8/H-9 — never a skip, never a vacuous pass):
// - stub or nonconforming product → the fixture run itself fails first, as a
//   diagnosed assertion failure (the expected pre-product red on this leg);
// - fixture ran, exchange missing/malformed → loud error: the product exists
//   but the Linux outputs are absent, so the artifact plumbing (or the Linux
//   leg's own fixture run) is broken;
// - fixture ran, exchange read, bytes differ → diagnosed assertion failure
//   naming the diverging step or workspace path — the E-6 platform
//   divergence this leg exists to catch.
