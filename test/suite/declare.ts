// Thin Vitest wrapper over the product-test registry (C-2 "one code path"):
// each suite file declares its section's registered entries with
// `declareProductTests`, and every body runs here against the default
// binding — the built product (helpers/subprocess.ts, builtProductBinding) —
// byte-for-byte the same body the certification runner executes against
// CERTIFICATIONS.md fixture products. No test hard-codes the product path.
//
// Membership guard: an entry declared to Vitest but absent from the manifest
// (test/suite/registry/index.ts) would run in the suite yet be invisible to
// certification and to the S-7 red-green sweep — so declaration refuses it
// outright.
