// E-6 Linux-side leg of the cross-platform byte-identity comparison
// (TEST-SPEC §18 E-6; CI-01). Runs the representative fixture — `version`,
// `build`, `check`, `query`, `coverage`, `impact`, `occurrences`,
// `view --text`, `at`, a `move --preview`, a journaled `rename`, a journaled
// file-form `move`, an `audit` review session, and a nested-working-directory
// `inventory` — against the built product
// (helpers/e6.ts), asserting every step's exact exit code, and writes the
// captured outputs (transcript + final workspace tree) into
// XSPEC_E6_EXCHANGE_DIR when it is set. The suite-linux CI job sets that
// variable and uploads the directory as the `e6-linux-outputs` artifact; the
// Windows leg (test/windows/e6-byte-identity.test.ts) reruns the identical
// fixture and compares byte-for-byte (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
//
// This is a product-facing test: against the stub product it fails at the
// fixture's first step as a diagnosed assertion failure (H-8) and writes
// nothing — the artifact upload tolerates the empty directory
// (if-no-files-found: ignore). Without the environment variable (local runs)
// the fixture still runs in full as an ordinary test; only the exchange write
// is conditional — never the test itself (H-9: no skips).
//
// Not a registry entry: the E-6 exchange is §18 execution machinery keyed to
// no TEST-SPEC T/P ID and no CERTIFICATIONS.md scope; the §1–16 behavior it
// touches is owned by the per-section registered tests. Its product
// invocations still go through the one C-2 binding surface.
