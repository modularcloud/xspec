// TEST-SPEC §8 (coverage) — SUITE-30: T8-1…T8-5, T8.2-1.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes reports through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 8: coverage is graph reachability over dependency edges between
// non-root participants — a target requirement is covered for a profile when
// a permitted path exists from a boundary node to it: one edge in `direct`
// mode, one or more in `transitive` mode, using only the profile's
// `edgeKinds`. `contains` edges never grant coverage and never appear in
// coverage paths; root nodes never appear in coverage paths either — not as
// boundary node, intermediate, or target — while roots remain nodes of their
// groups and root-sourced/root-targeted dependency edges remain ordinary for
// policy (7.5), impact (9.2), effectiveHash (5.5), and query (11): the
// exclusion is coverage-scoped. SPEC 8.1: required = the target group's
// nodes, restricted by `targetTags` when present and to leaves under the
// default `targets: "leaves"`, excluding `coverage="none"` nodes and always
// excluding roots. SPEC 8.2: all profiles run by default, one when named;
// the report carries the four counts, every covered/uncovered/ignored
// identity, one shortest covering path per covered node (ties by the 12.0
// element-wise byte-least sequence), and each ignored node's exclusion
// reasons — all that apply, in the fixed order root node, `coverage="none"`,
// non-leaf under `targets: "leaves"`, lacking every `targetTags` tag;
// `--check` exits 1 iff any required node is uncovered; JSON carries the
// same information.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-3/H-4):
// - SPEC 8.2 fixes membership, per-node information, and counts — no row or
//   profile order. Profiles are looked up by name and row sets compared
//   sorted; covering paths are order-sensitive sequences and compared
//   exactly.
// - Ignored-reason spellings are output shape: `classifyIgnoredReasons`
//   (helpers/adapters/reports.ts) maps each reported reason string onto the
//   four SPEC 8.2 reason identities, failing loudly on an unclassifiable or
//   ambiguous one (H-3). The tests then assert reason identity and the fixed
//   order as values.
// - T8-1…T8-5 assert covered rows (exact paths) and uncovered membership;
//   counts and ignored composition are T8.2-1's subject (the discipline
//   T7.4-2 fixed). Required-set composition is observed through
//   covered ∪ uncovered (SPEC 8.1/8.2: required = covered ∪ uncovered).
// - T8.2-1's "same information" arms: the JSON document is decoded and
//   asserted in full; `coverage <name>` and `coverage --check` outputs are
//   adapter-decoded and compared for information equality against the
//   default run (a product-to-itself comparison, order-normalized); the
//   human report is checked to mention the same distinctive information —
//   profile names, every covered/uncovered/ignored identity, the covering
//   path's boundary member, and the count digits (identities and profile
//   names in the fixture are digit-free, so digits in the report render
//   counts) — robust matching, never wording (H-3).
// - T8-5's impact arm follows the SUITE-20 (§5.6) conventions: entries are
//   merged per node identity (SPEC 9.3 fixes the grouping by category, not
//   the adapter-level entry granularity); an uncategorized, undeleted node
//   appears in no entry (the T1.5-1 convention); the propagated
//   `descendant-changed`/`upstream-changed` attributions are pinned to the
//   edited leaf per SPEC 5.6's worked single-leaf-edit example, and the
//   originating `changed` attribution is bounded within the originating set
//   (empty accepted).
// - T8-5's policy findings are compared as sorted "rule :: kind: from -> to"
//   renderings plus an exact 14.12 condition count, after a successful
//   `build` in the same workspace (the SUITE-29 protocol: check runs over
//   fresh output, no 14.10 contamination, so the staged violations are the
//   run's only findings).
