// TEST-SPEC §16 P-10 (concurrency) — PROP-08.
//
// One registered product-facing property test (C-2 "one code path"): a
// seeded, reproducible generator (helpers/property.ts, H-10; fixed seed set
// in CI, E-5) produces randomized schedules of episodes over one workspace —
// each episode exactly one mutating command (`rename`, file-form `move`, or
// `review resolve`), choreographed through the `--test-hold` seam via the
// subprocess driver's background-start, hold-file, and kill support
// (helpers/subprocess.ts, HARNESS-02) — with concurrent readers throughout:
// drawn read commands during the held phase and straddling the
// release-to-exit commit window, plus a continuous polling reader over every
// file path the schedule's mutating commands ever write. P-10's two invariant
// families are asserted post-hoc:
//
//   * readers observe only prior-or-complete file states (SPEC 13.5, cited
//     via T13.5-5 — CERTIFICATIONS.md: P-10's reader half shares T13.5-5's
//     polling machinery): every distinct content the poller observes at a
//     path must byte-equal one of that path's settled states — the states
//     captured in quiescence after staging and after each episode — with
//     absence a state like any other. The settled list enumerates every
//     legitimate complete state because each episode's mutator writes each
//     polled path at most once (a rename rewrites the source in place and
//     regenerates its module, 6.4; a file move deletes the origin and
//     creates the destination, 6.5; a resolve rewrites the session, 10.7;
//     a journaled operation appends one self-contained entry, 6.1) and no
//     concurrent reader writes any polled path (the journal and sessions
//     are written only by their owning commands, 6.1/10.4/13.4; sources by
//     nothing but rename/move; generated modules only by build-style
//     regeneration — and the read menu deliberately excludes `build`, whose
//     concurrent module writes 13.5 last-write-wins would legitimize).
//     The journal is additionally order-checked: successive observations
//     prefix-monotone (append-only, 6.1) and never absent after content
//     (never deleted, 6.1/13.4).
//   * mutual exclusion never loses a journal append or a resolution,
//     accounted post-hoc at each quiescent point: journal lines = successful
//     `rename`/`move` operations — the journal's only writers (6.1) — as
//     exactly one appended entry per completed journaled episode (previous
//     bytes a strict prefix), byte-identity across every resolve episode and
//     every held-point kill, and a zero-entry journal before the first one;
//     session statuses = successful resolves — the item-id set never changes
//     after `create` and every item's status equals the status set by its
//     last completed resolve (`unresolved` before any), read back after
//     every episode and cross-checked at the end against `review list`'s
//     stored-status counts (10.7), with every bracketing read asserted to
//     leave journal and session bytes untouched (10.4, 13.4).
//
// Kill model (SPEC 13.5 "exclusivity ends when the holding command's process
// terminates, normally or abnormally"):
//   * held-point kills for every mutating kind: the hold precedes all
//     modification (T13.5-1), so the settled workspace must be byte-identical
//     across the episode on every polled path — the deterministic no-op that
//     keeps kill/success interleavings exactly accountable. Every episode
//     after a kill also exercises the terminated-holder clause: the next
//     mutating command must reach its own hold and complete.
//   * post-release kills (a drawn delay after hold release, then SIGKILL)
//     for resolve episodes only. Conservative operationalization (H-3/H-4,
//     noted): a post-release-killed rename/move can leave sources invalid,
//     after which 13.3 entitles every review read to refuse (exit 1) and the
//     session accounting would become unassertable — that regime belongs to
//     T13.5-7's disjunctive `check` contract. A killed resolve touches only
//     the session file (10.7, 13.4), so sources stay valid, reads stay
//     asserted, and the kill outcome is exactly two-valued: the target
//     item's status is its prior value or the attempted one — whichever the
//     next quiescent read observes is adopted (the session holds a definite
//     state once the process is dead; atomic visibility excludes anything
//     else) and accounting continues exactly.
//   * kill delays come from a fixed list — scheduling choreography only,
//     never an assertion input (H-10): every assertion is delay-independent.
//
// Concurrent read commands (the menu: `check`, `ids --json`, `query nodes`,
// `review status s --json`, `review list --json` — fixed valid argv, none
// writes a polled path):
//   * held-phase reads run to completion while the mutator is held and must
//     exit 0: the workspace is valid, built, and unmodified while held
//     (T13.5-4's premise). Graph data is fresh at every held point: the
//     quiescent accounting read between episodes refreshes it (13.3) after
//     any commit-window read/mutator write race left it stale.
//   * straddle reads start immediately before the release (or kill) and are
//     awaited after the mutator settles: asserted to terminate without
//     signal death and to exit 0 or 1 — a read overlapping a move's commit
//     window can see the file at neither or both paths (per-path atomicity
//     promises nothing across paths), so transient validation failures are
//     legitimate, but usage errors are not (argv and configuration are fixed
//     valid) and neither is a crash or hang (H-8, 12.0).
//
// Validity discipline (every completed mutating command must exit 0):
//   * `rename` targets a top-level id that exists in the generator's file
//     model with a fresh valid name; file-form `move` targets a fresh
//     `specs/M<n>.mdx` destination (never an existing path). The model
//     evolves only on *completed* rename/move draws, so generation and
//     replay stay deterministic under kills: held-point kills modify
//     nothing, and post-release kills apply only to resolves, which never
//     touch sources (the P-9 concretization pattern).
//   * `resolve` targets only unblocked items — picked by rank from the
//     immediately preceding quiescent `review status` read, with nothing
//     running in between (execution-time rank resolution, the P-9 pattern:
//     item ids are product-assigned, so the generator cannot name them).
//
// Invalidation cannot occur in these schedules — no source edits happen,
// completed renames/moves are pure (6.2: they leave every hash byte-stable
// and by themselves invalidate nothing, 10.4), and killed mutators either
// modified nothing (held point) or touched only the session — so recorded
// hashes always match the current graph and every presented status equals
// the stored status (10.4): the status accounting reads exactly what
// resolves stored. P-10 is outside every CERTIFICATIONS.md fixture scope
// (its preamble), so this body binds only to the real product surface.
//
// The initial workspace is fixed (one importless spec file; audit session
// `s` — no baseline, no git, T10.6-1): P-10's search space is the schedule
// interleavings; workspace-shape search belongs to P-1…P-9. An
// implementation-time dry-run over the committed default seeds at the
// registered 3 runs per seed verified the fixed trial set covers the full
// menu: both journal writers, all three fates (held kills of all three
// kinds, post-release kills at several delays), all three resolve statuses,
// and every read command in both held and straddle position.
