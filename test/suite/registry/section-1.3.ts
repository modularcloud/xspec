// TEST-SPEC §1.3 (requirement IDs) — SUITE-02: T1.3-1 … T1.3-6.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes findings through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8). Error
// reports are asserted for the SPEC.md 14 required information — condition
// identity, file, location, and (14.2) a statement of the expected form —
// never exact wording.
//
// CONF-VALID in-scope (CERTIFICATIONS.md §CONF-VALID): every fixture stays
// within that entry's scope — one configured spec group of `.mdx` sources
// whose sections carry `id`/`tags` props only; no imports, embeddings, `d`
// props, code groups, `markdown`, `coverage`, `policy`, or git; the command
// surface is `build` (error reporting of 14.1–14.4) plus `query nodes`.
// T1.3-5's cross-file duplicate-ID arm is the multi-file case.
//
// Location assertions: fixtures are staged as prefix + offending construct +
// suffix, all pure ASCII (string indices are byte offsets), and each negative
// arm asserts the finding's location falls within the offending construct's
// own byte window. The window is end-widened by one byte so a product
// reporting a line-granular location (last construct line plus its
// terminator) still passes; every other staged construct lies outside the
// widened window, so a finding attributed to the wrong construct fails.
