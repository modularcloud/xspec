// TEST-SPEC §3 (Markdown compilation) — SUITE-11: T3-1, T3-2, T3-3, T3-4,
// T3-5, T3-6.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), and byte-asserts the emitted Markdown files
// (H-4: SPEC 3 fixes the output bytes exactly) — every expectation below is a
// hand-derived byte string from the fixture's known source and the
// removal/replacement/line-drop/terminator rules of SPEC 3. All tests run
// with `markdown: { emit: true }` except T3-6, which is the emission-scope
// test itself (SPEC 7.3, 13.2).
//
// Certification staging constraints (CERTIFICATIONS.md §CONF-MD,
// §VIOL-MD-CLASS, §VIOL-MD-CR), binding alongside the test text:
// - U+00A0, U+0085, and U+2028 appear on removal-affected lines only in
//   T3-3's class-boundary arms; every other fixture in this module keeps
//   them out entirely.
// - A lone U+000D appears only in T3-4's fixtures; every other fixture uses
//   LF terminators exclusively (CRLF appears only in T3-4).
// - T3-1 stages sections carrying the full prop set of 2.7 — `id`, `d`
//   (external and local forms, resolving as staged), `coverage`, and `tags`,
//   plus the grammar-boundary staging: its fenced code blocks and inline
//   code span carry construct-like bytes that must stay literal content
//   (constructs exist only where the MDX parse yields them).
