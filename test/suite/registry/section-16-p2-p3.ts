// TEST-SPEC §16 P-2 + P-3 (Markdown compilation / text algebra) — PROP-02.
//
// Two registered product-facing property tests (C-2 "one code path") sharing
// one seeded random-document generator (helpers/property.ts, H-10; fixed seed
// set in CI, E-5). Each trial generates a workspace of 1–3 `.mdx` spec
// sources composed of prose blocks — fenced code blocks and inline code
// spans spelling tag-, import-, and expression-like bytes included (T3-1's
// grammar boundary: such bytes are content) — nested sections, imports,
// single- and multi-line MDX comments, and same-file and cross-file
// `{text(...)}` embeddings, over mixed line terminators (LF, CRLF, lone CR),
// with content weighted toward the whitespace/non-whitespace boundary code
// points of SPEC 1.4 (U+00A0, U+0085, U+2028 included) — exactly the P-2
// input space.
//
//   * P-2 — for every file, `build` under `markdown: { emit: true }` emits
//     Markdown byte-equal to the independent harness oracle
//     (helpers/oracles/markdown.ts, S-6-vetted; H-4 byte assertions);
//     compilation is deterministic (H-6: the identical workspace built in a
//     second directory yields byte-identical emissions); and content bytes
//     outside removed constructs are preserved — asserted directly, without
//     the oracle: every logical line no construct touches must appear
//     verbatim, in order, in the emitted output (such a line can never drop:
//     the SPEC 3 drop rule fires only for lines left empty or
//     whitespace-only *purely by removals*).
//   * P-3 — the text algebra of SPEC 1.6, asserted purely as internal
//     consistency of the product's own reported values (no oracle): the root
//     node's subtree text equals the file's compiled Markdown output
//     byte-for-byte, and every node's subtree text equals its own-text runs
//     interleaved with its children's subtree texts in document order — N
//     children yielding N + 1 runs, so |subtree| = |own| + Σ|child subtree|
//     and a run decomposition exists that splits the reported own text into
//     exactly N + 1 runs (empty runs counting) around the children's
//     reported subtree texts.
//
// CONF-MD in-scope (CERTIFICATIONS.md): both properties run against the
// CONF-MD conformer, and P-2 is certified by §VIOL-MD-CLASS (the line-drop
// rule classifying U+00A0/U+0085/U+2028 as whitespace) and §VIOL-MD-CR (a
// lone U+000D not recognized as a line terminator). The generator reaches
// both flip classes deterministically under the fixed seed set: comment
// lines left holding only boundary code points after removal (kept by SPEC
// 1.4/3, dropped under the CLASS deviation), and lone-CR terminators on and
// around removal-affected lines (line extents, and therefore drops and kept
// bytes, diverge under the CR deviation) — verified by a per-seed dry-run
// against deviation-simulating oracles at implementation time, and
// re-verified per seed against the violator executables themselves when the
// fence/code-span staging landed (the choice streams shifted). P-3 asserts
// only product-internal consistency, which both violators preserve
// ("consistently in Markdown output and, through 1.6, in own and subtree
// text"), so P-3 passes against every CONF-MD fixture while P-2 fails
// against exactly the violators. The bodies stay within the CONF-MD command
// surface: `build` plus `query node` decoded through the scoped own/subtree
// text adapter (decodeNodeTextSummary) — nothing beyond own and subtree
// text is demanded of a scoped fixture product.
//
// Staging discipline (byte-exact per HARNESS-01; the generator, not the
// oracle, owns these choices):
//   * Generated free prose draws from an alphabet that excludes
//     MDX-structural characters — `<`, `{`, `}`, backtick, `~`, `>`, `&`,
//     `\` — so a prose byte can never open a fence, JSX tag, expression
//     container, blockquote lazy-continuation, or character reference that
//     would make the product's construct parse diverge from the generator's
//     structure. Everything else (Markdown punctuation included) is plain
//     content to SPEC 3, which never interprets Markdown semantics.
//   * Backticks and `~` appear only inside deliberately staged fenced code
//     blocks and inline code spans (T3-1's grammar boundary, the P-2 entry's
//     named inclusion) — complete by construction and within the grammar
//     subset every certified model shares: fences open at column 0 with a
//     run of 3–4 backticks or tildes plus an optional backtick-free
//     identifier info string, close with a bare run of the same character
//     and length, and hold interior lines that never spell a fence marker
//     (the interior alphabet has no backtick or `~`); code spans are
//     single-line, open and close with equal-length runs of 1–2 backticks,
//     and hold a non-empty backtick-free interior (an empty interior would
//     merge the two runs into one). Interior bytes spell the construct-like
//     forms T3-1 fixes — `<S id="x">`, `<div>`,
//     `import X from "./X.xspec"`, `{text("a")}` — plus free prose. Every
//     fence and span byte is a `content` entry: constructs exist only where
//     the MDX parse yields them, so the oracle treats these bytes as
//     content (preserved verbatim; their lines carry the marker or span
//     runs as non-whitespace, and interior blank or whitespace-only lines
//     are untouched lines, kept), and the direct byte-preservation
//     assertion sees them as ordinary untouched lines.
//   * Section tags, imports, and embeddings are single-line and ASCII; the
//     exotic bytes live in content, where P-2 aims them. Multi-line comments
//     carry 1–2 internal terminators and no internal blank line (MDX
//     expressions admit none); the comment alphabet contains no `/`, so a
//     premature `*/` cannot form.
//   * Line terminators are drawn per line; a deterministic guard keeps a
//     lone-CR terminator from being followed by an empty line's LF (the two
//     bytes would merge into one CRLF terminator and desynchronize the
//     generator's line model from the bytes on disk).
//   * Every file begins (after imports) with one construct-free plain-prose
//     line, so no file compiles to empty output — whether an all-dropped
//     source emits a zero-byte file is not a SPEC 3 question and not staged.
//   * Embedding and `d` references target only sections already closed
//     (earlier in the same file, or any section of an imported earlier
//     file): references resolve, no target is an ancestor, and the embeds
//     graph is acyclic by construction (SPEC 5.3), so expansions are
//     computable bottom-up in definition order.
//   * Embedding targets are restricted to shapes whose subtree text SPEC
//     1.6/3 pins exactly: self-closing sections (empty), single-line inline
//     sections hosted on lines guaranteed to keep (their interior bytes),
//     and block sections whose opening and closing tags stand alone on
//     their lines (the compiled interior — the drop rule is line-local, so
//     the interior compiles compositionally; validated against T3-2's
//     hand-derived chain).
