// TEST-SPEC §6.3 (baseline resolution) — SUITE-23: T6.3-1…T6.3-4.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 6.3: a baseline graph is reconstructed from the workspace content at
// the ref — sources and configuration alike, so group membership reflects the
// configuration as it stood at the ref. A journal absent at the ref or in the
// current workspace reads as an empty journal, and an empty journal is a
// prefix of every journal. Entries present in the current journal but absent
// from the journal content at the baseline ref are applied, in file order, to
// map baseline identities to current identities; chained mappings compose.
// Replay that produces an unresolvable mapping, a baseline journal that is
// not a prefix of the current journal, and baseline content that cannot be
// parsed and validated all MUST fail with an actionable error naming the
// offending entries or files; a baseline that cannot be read or reconstructed
// is a usage error (12.0, exit 2), and baseline resolution precedes source
// validation (12.0).
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - "Resolves normally" / "reports no changes" is asserted as an empty
//   `requirements` list plus empty impacted-code groups — the suite's fixed
//   T1.5-1 interpretation (SPEC 9.3 groups output by category, so an
//   uncategorized node appears under none), carried through SUITE-20/22.
// - Every failure arm runs with `--json`: exit 2 exactly (H-5), stdout
//   exactly one 12.7 error document (12.0: with JSON output in effect, an
//   exit-2 invocation emits the error document as its entire stdout), and
//   the actionable error on stderr (12.0: usage and configuration error
//   messages are standard-error content).
// - "Naming the offending entries" for the garbage replay line (staged on
//   journal line 2, after one legitimate entry): entry content is opaque
//   (SPEC 6.1, H-4), so the harness accepts any of — stderr echoing the
//   garbage line's text, stderr citing line/entry 2, or a `journal:2`
//   file:line form. The T6.1-3 operationalization, applied to the stderr
//   channel.
// - "Naming the offending entries or files" for prefix violations: the
//   offending file is the journal, so stderr must name it — it must match
//   /journal/i (satisfied by the path `.xspec/journal` or the word).
// - A baseline whose sources fail parse/validation: stderr must name the
//   offending file — it must contain the file's name (`Broken.mdx`).
// - An unresolvable ref: the offending item is the ref itself, so the
//   actionable error must echo its spelling on stderr.
// - "Report no validation findings" (the precedence arm): findings are
//   report content — stdout (12.0) — so under `--json` the exit-2 error
//   document (which carries no `findings` member, 12.7) as the entire
//   stdout is exactly "no validation findings reported".
// - "Modifying nothing" is asserted as a whole-workspace-root byte snapshot
//   compare around the command, `.git/` included (git is read-only for the
//   product, SPEC preamble; T12.0-11 pins `.git/` byte-identity around every
//   git-reading invocation).
//
// Journal tampering below stays product-independent (H-4): a strictly longer
// baseline journal can be a prefix of no shorter current journal, whatever
// the entry bytes are; the appended garbage line is structureless bytes no
// conforming entry format accepts (T6.1-3's sanctioned staging), appended as
// a whole line under either final-line convention.
