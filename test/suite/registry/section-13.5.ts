// TEST-SPEC §13.5 (concurrency and isolation) — SUITE-48: T13.5-1 (hold-seam
// basics: five held mutating-command arms, the occupied-hold-path exit-2
// arms, and the non-mutating unknown-flag arm), T13.5-2 (mutual exclusion),
// T13.5-3 (exclusivity ends with the process), T13.5-4 (readers during
// mutation + build/query storm), T13.5-5 (atomic visibility via a polling
// reader), T13.5-6 (workspace isolation), T13.5-7 (interrupted mutation:
// held-point kill and a post-release kill-timing spread with the disjunctive
// `check` assertion).
//
// All mutual-exclusion choreography goes through the `--test-hold <path>`
// seam (SPEC 13.5) via the subprocess driver's background-start, hold-file,
// and kill support (helpers/subprocess.ts, HARNESS-02). Hold paths live in
// the workspace's tempRoot — outside the workspace root — so whole-root byte
// snapshots never see them; `--test-hold` resolves against the working
// directory (SPEC 12.0; T12.0-5), so the absolute path is exact.
//
// CERTIFICATIONS.md staging constraints (binding; T13.5-1…T13.5-5 are
// §CONF-CORE in-scope):
// - Every mutating command these tests drive is `rename`, file-form `move`
//   (never the section form), or a mutating `review` subcommand with
//   `create` under `--strategy audit` (§CONF-CORE), and the in-scope
//   fixtures stay in CONF-CORE's workspace shape: one spec group of
//   importless, tagless `.mdx` sources; no `code`, `markdown`, `coverage`,
//   or `policy` keys; no git.
// - T13.5-2's excluded commands carry no `--test-hold` (§VIOL-CORE-NOLOCK),
//   and its modifies-nothing compare brackets each excluded command alone,
//   with the baseline snapshot taken while command 1 is already held
//   (§VIOL-CORE-EARLYWRITE).
// - T13.5-3's subsequent mutating command succeeds whether or not the killed
//   operation's writes landed — `rename specs/A.mdx g g2`, independent of
//   the killed `a`→`a2` and never a retry of it (§VIOL-CORE-EARLYWRITE).
// - T13.5-4's storm arm asserts termination only — the storm commands' exit
//   codes are deliberately unasserted — plus the final `build`'s
//   byte-equality to a clean build; its held-phase reads run while the
//   mutator is held (§VIOL-CORE-PARTIALWRITE's expected-failure analysis
//   depends on exactly this shape). The clean-build compare excludes the
//   journal — durable, not derived (SPEC 13.4): the 13.5 tests assert hold,
//   exclusion, and derived-file behavior, never journal bytes
//   (§VIOL-CORE-CHATTYREADS's expected-failure analysis depends on exactly
//   that); whether `build` and read commands modify the journal is T6.1-1's
//   and T13.4-5's charter.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-3/H-4):
// - "Proceeds only once the file is deleted" (T13.5-1): the deterministic
//   check is the whole-root byte snapshot while held (nothing modified) —
//   certified via VIOL-CORE-EARLYWRITE — plus: the process is still running
//   after that snapshot's full-tree read completes, and exits 0 only after
//   the harness deletes the hold file.
// - "Fails promptly" (T13.5-1 occupied path, T13.5-2): a bounded foreground
//   run — a product that blocks instead of failing is killed at the bound
//   and fails diagnosed (H-8; the bound is a hang guard, never an assertion
//   input, H-10) — and for T13.5-2 the excluded command's exit is observed
//   while command 1 is still held (asserted: command 1 has not exited).
// - "Observe the prior state" (T13.5-4): each read command's exit code and
//   stdout bytes while the rename is held equal the same invocation's from
//   before the rename started (SPEC 12.0 byte-determinism: identical
//   workspace bytes, identical answers).
// - "Never a partial file" (T13.5-5): every distinct content the polling
//   reader observes must byte-equal one of the completed builds' contents
//   for the polled path (the set of post-build reads), and no absence may
//   be observed after content has been observed or after the first build
//   completed. A build's "new content" is thus its completed content — the
//   only enumerable reading of "prior content, complete new content, or
//   absence-before-first-write" from the observer side.
// - T13.5-6 stages two *differing* workspaces (different file names, IDs,
//   and texts), so cross-workspace interference cannot cancel out: a
//   held-overlap probe (workspace 2's mutating command succeeds while
//   workspace 1's is held — exclusion is per workspace) plus a
//   concurrent-vs-serial compare of a six-command script (per-step exit
//   codes and stdout bytes, and the final workspace trees, H-6
//   two-directory style).
// - T13.5-7's kill-timing spread is a fixed delay list — kill scheduling is
//   choreography, never an assertion input (H-10); the operative assertion
//   is delay-independent and disjunctive exactly as specified: after a
//   post-release kill, `check` exits 0 or 1 (never a signal death, never
//   another code — the configuration is intact, so the exit-2 class is not
//   stageable), and after a held-point kill it exits 0 (the hold precedes
//   all modification).
