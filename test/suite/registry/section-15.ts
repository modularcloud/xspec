// TEST-SPEC §15 (example) — SUITE-50: T15-1, the canonical walkthrough over
// SPEC.md §15's exact workspace.
//
// Registered product-facing body (C-2 "one code path"): it builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// The fixture is SPEC.md §15's exact workspace — `specs/SPEC.mdx`,
// `specs/DERIVED.mdx`, `src/hello.ts`, byte for byte — plus a matching
// configuration (§15 shows none): the two spec files in their own spec groups
// so the coverage profile's required set is exactly `print.hello` (SPEC 8.1:
// default `targets: "leaves"` over the group holding SPEC.mdx), the code
// group named `src` (T15-1: "`src` as code boundary"), and one transitive
// coverage profile targeting `print.hello` with `src` as boundary
// (boundaryKind inferred — the name is unambiguous, SPEC 7.4).
//
// One integration test walks SPEC 15's narrative in one workspace:
// build → the six listed graph edges exactly → the satisfied coverage
// profile → the `print.hello` text edit with its categories, impacted code,
// and the default path-blocks session → the rename taken *instead* (the edit
// reverted to its exact baseline bytes first, so the rename runs against the
// same pre-rename baseline) with its journal mapping and no-change impact
// run.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-3/H-4):
// - The six edges are the complete unfiltered `query edges` set, compared
//   order-insensitively (SPEC 5.2: edges of each kind form a set; SPEC 11).
// - "Satisfied via hello → derived.hello → print.hello" is the profile's
//   covered row for `print.hello` with exactly that path (unique in this
//   fixture: the location's one references edge, then the one depends edge),
//   an empty uncovered list, and `coverage --check` exiting 0 (SPEC 8.2:
//   1 iff any required node is uncovered).
// - The categories follow the SUITE-20 conventions: entries merged per node
//   identity; an uncategorized node appears in no entry (the T1.5-1
//   convention); the propagated categories' attribution is pinned to
//   `print.hello` (SPEC 15: "via print.hello"; SPEC 5.6's worked
//   single-leaf-edit example attributes the whole cascade to the leaf) and
//   the originating `changed` attribution is bounded within {print.hello}.
//   The impacted-code groups are asserted whole (SUITE-31): `hello.ts#hello`
//   transitively impacted — its one impact edge targets `derived.hello`,
//   whose effectiveHash alone changed — and no location directly impacted.
// - "A default path-blocks session" is created with `review create --base`
//   and no `--strategy` (SPEC 10.7); "exactly the four listed items" is the
//   exact kind+scope set, and "blocked by it" the parent-consistency item's
//   blockedBy = {the subtree-coherence item's id} with every other item's
//   blockedBy empty (SPEC 10.2: empty except where the strategy assigns;
//   10.5 assigns blockers only to parent-consistency items). Item payloads
//   in depth are T10.5-1's business.
// - "The journal records the mapping" sticks to SPEC 6.1's observable
//   contract (entry content is opaque, H-4): absent before the rename (the
//   file comes into existence with the first journaled operation; nothing
//   else may write it), a plain file with exactly one line-oriented entry
//   after it, and the mapping's effect — the pre-rename baseline's impact
//   run reports no changes because identities map through the journal
//   (SPEC 6.2, 6.3). A rewrite premise on DERIVED.mdx's reference spelling
//   (SPEC 6.4) fails a missing rewrite crisply ahead of the impact
//   assertion; byte-exact rewrites are T6.4-2's business.
