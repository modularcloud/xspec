// TEST-SPEC §13.4 (derived and durable files) — SUITE-47: T13.4-1 (plain
// committable files + sorted keys), T13.4-2 (derived reproducibility),
// T13.4-3 (orphan knowledge boundary), T13.4-4 (derived paths belong to
// xspec), T13.4-5 (durable protection), T13.4-6 (symlink write rules).
// T13.4-7 registers no test body: its TEST-SPEC entry is a cross-reference —
// T7-6 (section-7-discovery.ts) carries the `.xspec.` / `.xspec/` /
// emit-destination source exclusion. (A registered no-op body would pass
// against the stub product and violate the S-7 red-green sweep, H-8; the H-7
// traceability map routes §13.4's source-exclusion passage to T7-6.)
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-3/H-4):
// - "Every file xspec writes is a plain file" (T13.4-1): the harness stages
//   only regular files, so the scan asserts that no entry outside `.git/`
//   anywhere in the workspace is a symlink or other non-plain kind — any
//   such entry is product-written.
// - The T13.4-1 git round trip compares regular-file entries byte-exactly
//   (git does not represent empty directories; 13.4 constrains files) and
//   asserts the round-tripped behavior directly: after commit, worktree
//   wipe, and clean checkout, `check` stays clean, reads answer
//   byte-identically (12.0: byte-deterministic output for byte-identical
//   input), and a rebuild reproduces the same fixed point.
// - Byte-exact restoration compares (T13.4-2, T13.4-3, T13.4-4) are the H-4
//   self-comparison carve-out: product output compared against the product's
//   own output for identical build input. In T13.4-4 the reference is a
//   second workspace whose staged difference is confined to derived-file
//   paths — occupants of derived paths are never sources (13.4) and derived
//   output is a function of sources, configuration, and the journal alone
//   (13.4), so conforming builds of both workspaces yield byte-identical
//   trees.
// - T13.4-5 stays inside CERTIFICATIONS.md §CONF-CORE's scope (the test is
//   in-scope there): one spec group of importless, tagless `.mdx` sources;
//   no `code`, `markdown`, `coverage`, or `policy` keys; no git; mutating
//   commands drawn from `rename` and `review` under `--strategy audit`. In
//   this git-less scope `impact --base HEAD` is the exit-2
//   unreadable-baseline case (SPEC 6.3, 12.0) — asserted as such, durables
//   still untouched. Staging constraint (§VIOL-CORE-PERSISTREADS): the
//   fixture session holds no stale resolution while the `build`-and-read
//   byte-compares run — the one resolve is the last staging step and no
//   source changes afterward, so read-time invalidation computes nothing.
// - T13.4-6 refusal arm: the symlinked write-path component is staged as
//   `markdown.outDir` naming a symlink to a real directory inside the
//   workspace root (no outside-root confound, 14.14). With one source file,
//   exactly one write path (`out/specs/A.md`) traverses the link, so `build
//   --json` must report exactly one 14.22 and nothing else (the sources are
//   valid, and build cannot observe 14.10, 12.1). `check` must report the
//   same 14.22 without writing; 14.10 staleness findings are tolerated
//   beside it (no build has ever succeeded, so every derived file is
//   missing); any other condition fails.
// - T13.4-6 plain-file occupant and cardinality arms: every staging is a
//   first emission — no build has ever run and the occupant is staged in the
//   workspace declaration — and no move operand is involved (a plain-file
//   component under a move's destination or its derived paths is the move's
//   `refused-invalid-destination` instead, SPEC 6.5, 14.22; T6.5-4). Under
//   OUT_CONFIG emission preserves workspace-relative paths (SPEC 7.3), so
//   each staged component is a workspace-relative directory component of a
//   `build` write path and the staged occupants are exactly the offending
//   components: the arms assert the complete condition-22 finding set with
//   each finding's concerned path equal to its component (SPEC 14.22 — one
//   finding per distinct offending component, whatever write paths it
//   refuses; a product refusing at a different component, once per refused
//   write, or per occupant kind rather than per component fails the count
//   or the path equality). The `build`-side finding set is exact (sources
//   valid; `build` cannot observe 14.10, 12.1); the `check` side counts
//   the condition-22 findings exactly and tolerates 14.10 beside them (as
//   above). The cardinality arms — one occupant under which two derived
//   files would be written yields one finding; two distinct offending
//   components yield two — are asserted via `check`, where TEST-SPEC pins
//   them; among equal-code findings with empty locations the pinned 12.7
//   order is concerned-path byte order, fixing the per-index comparison.
// - T13.4-6 durable arms: the journal occupant's link target is an empty
//   plain file — a valid empty journal — and the session occupant's link
//   target is the product's own healthy session file beside it, so a product
//   that reads or writes through the link sees a valid durable file and
//   proceeds; the exit-code and whole-workspace byte-compares then fail it
//   ("never read, appended, or replaced"). The mutating attempt's refusal
//   report content is unasserted (the section-6.4 precedent: TEST-SPEC pins
//   no report content for refusals), while the 14.13/14.21 condition
//   identities are asserted through `build --json` / `check --json` /
//   /corrupt/i vocabulary, leniently per the T6.1-3 and T10.1-4 precedents
//   (the staged condition present; cascades unpinned).
// - T13.4-6 positive arm: the product is driven with its working directory
//   given as a symbolic link (created beside the workspace root) resolving
//   to the real root, with `PWD` naming the link path — path components
//   above the workspace root are unrestricted (13.4), so `build`, a
//   journaled `rename`, and `check` must behave normally and land their
//   effects in the real root.
