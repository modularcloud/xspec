// TEST-SPEC §4.5 (dependency markers) — SUITE-15: T4.5-1 … T4.5-7.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes reports through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8). Runtime
// contracts run under standard TypeScript tooling with no xspec runtime
// dependency (SPEC 13.1) through helpers/tooling.ts, in the CommonJS-mode
// arrangement described in section-4.ts. Files under `src/` are discovered
// code-group sources.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4 — wording is free, so only
// the stated observables are asserted):
// - T4.5-1 "at runtime the program behaves as if the line were absent
//   (harmless property read) with no additional tooling installed": the
//   fixture stages two discovered code files differing in exactly the marker
//   line; both compile clean under standard tooling, and both compiled
//   programs run under plain Node (SPEC 13.1 — nothing installed beyond
//   standard TypeScript tooling) with identical observables: exit 0, stdout
//   exactly "Hello\n", empty stderr, the marker program's stdout
//   byte-compared to the marker-free program's.
// - T4.5-2 stages the root marker as the workspace's only dependency edge,
//   so every asserted value is forced: coverage can only be empty, the
//   impacted-code witness edge can only be the root-targeted `references`
//   edge, and with exactly one changed leaf there is exactly one qualifying
//   witness path (SPEC 9.3) — root → print → print.hello, every step
//   `contains`, every node's subtreeHash changed. Its upstream arm stages a
//   second workspace with exactly two dependency edges, each forced into its
//   role: the marker's `references` edge is the location's only impact edge,
//   and the root-sourced `embeds` edge is the root's only dependency edge —
//   after the cross-file edit the one qualifying witness path is root →
//   embedded target (the `contains` step to the untouched `local` child does
//   not qualify: its effectiveHash is unchanged), and the edge target's
//   subtreeHash staying unchanged is what the direct-group emptiness
//   asserts (SPEC 5.5, 9.2, 9.3).
// - T4.5-3 arms stage exactly one defect each — the non-static form. Every
//   arm's chain would resolve to an existing node if read statically
//   (`SPEC[key]` with key = "a"; the `a.b` chains with `a.b` staged), so a
//   product cannot legitimately reclassify the finding as an unresolved
//   reference (14.7): the sole present condition is 14.8, and the exact
//   condition-count assertion simultaneously pins "not 14.18" (SPEC 4.5).
// - T4.5-5 arms likewise stage exactly one unsanctioned value-level use
//   each; the exact condition-count assertion {"14.18": 1} pins the
//   classification (SPEC 4.5, 14.18).
// - Location assertions: every offending statement is staged at a known byte
//   offset in a pure-ASCII `src/app.ts`, so string indices are byte offsets
//   and each finding must fall within the offending statement's own byte
//   window (end-widened by one byte for line-granular locations, support.ts
//   byteWindow).
