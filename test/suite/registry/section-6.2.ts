// TEST-SPEC §6.2 (identity guarantee) — SUITE-22: T6.2-1…T6.2-4.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 6.2: `rename` and the file form of `move` are pure — they change only
// identities and reference spellings and leave every hash byte-identical,
// producing no change categories relative to any baseline, because child
// constructs and references hash by canonical identity (5.4), which journaled
// operations preserve. The section form of `move` is impure only through its
// text edits: the identity mapping itself changes no hash, and every moved
// node keeps its metadataHash unconditionally; own content can differ between
// origin and destination only on the construct's straddling lines, where the
// line-drop rule of 3 consults characters outside the moved text. Baselines
// are committed git sources (HARNESS-01: pinned identities and timestamps);
// the baseline commit precedes the first `build`, so it holds sources only.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - "No change categories" is asserted as an empty `requirements` list — the
//   suite's fixed T1.5-1 interpretation (SPEC 9.3 groups output by category,
//   so an uncategorized node appears under none), carried through SUITE-20.
// - "Full-workspace sweep" is realized as `query nodes` enumeration,
//   premise-asserted to equal the fixture's statically known identity set (a
//   sweep silently missing nodes could not witness "every node's four
//   hashes"), followed by `query node <identity>` for the four hashes of
//   each node (SPEC 11). Code locations are not requirement nodes and carry
//   no hashes; the sweep is over requirement nodes.
// - Impact entries here must all report `deleted: false`, and any identity
//   outside the expectation table — a pre-operation identity in particular —
//   fails: a product that does not unify identities through the journal
//   (SPEC 6.3, 9.2) reports the vacated identity as deleted and the new one
//   as added, and both are diagnosed.
// - T6.2-3 asserts, for every node of the moved subtree, exactly the three
//   hashes its TEST-SPEC text names (ownHash, subtreeHash, metadataHash);
//   effectiveHash is not asserted directly — TEST-SPEC deliberately omits it
//   (in general a moved subtree's effectiveHash can change through
//   dependency targets) — but the category table still bounds it: these
//   fixtures give the moved subtree no dependency edges, so an
//   `upstream-changed` entry for a moved node would fail as an extra
//   category.
// - T6.2-3's category table pins what SPEC 5.6 decides and bounds what it
//   leaves open. Decided: which nodes are `changed` (exactly the origin and
//   target parents, plus the impure-boundary moved node in the impure arm);
//   the file roots' `descendant-changed` (their changed parent is a
//   descendant present on both sides); the dependents' `upstream-changed`
//   with exact attribution (a dependency-edge target's effectiveHash changed;
//   the edge's target is identity-mapped, so the cascade is unambiguous —
//   the sharp realization of "with the 5.6 cascades attributed to it").
//   Left open, and tolerated: whether a parent whose (former or new) child
//   changed while under it on only one side — the impure moved node departed
//   the origin parent and arrived under the target parent — additionally
//   carries `descendant-changed`, since SPEC 5.6's baseline comparison is
//   defined for nodes present on both sides and the moved node is a
//   descendant of each parent on only one side. Such an entry is accepted
//   only when attributed to the moved node; any other spelling fails.
// - Attribution of the originating category `changed` is unpinned by
//   TEST-SPEC (SPEC 5.6 bounds it to originating nodes), so it is asserted
//   as a subset of the fixture's originating-node set, the empty list
//   accepted — the SUITE-20 convention.
