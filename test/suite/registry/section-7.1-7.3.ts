// TEST-SPEC §7.1–7.3 (spec groups, code groups, markdown configuration) —
// SUITE-28: T7.1-1, T7.2-1, T7.3-1. Configuration basics (T7-1…T7-3) live in
// section-7-basics.ts, discovery (T7-4…T7-6) in section-7-discovery.ts; the
// §7.4–7.5 profile/rule tests belong to SUITE-29.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes reports through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 7.1: spec groups are named glob lists; a file MAY belong to multiple
// groups; every matched file MUST have the `.mdx` extension, any other match
// being invalid (14.19). SPEC 7.2: code groups serve as coverage boundaries
// and as the impacted-code population; a file matched by both a spec and a
// code group is a configuration error (14.14). SPEC 7.3: `markdown` absent →
// no emission; when present, `emit` (boolean) is REQUIRED and controls
// emission; `outDir` redirects emitted files preserving workspace-relative
// paths, resolves against the workspace root, and MUST resolve within it
// (else 14.14); the configured emit destinations exist exactly while emission
// is enabled — with `emit: true` they are the destination paths whether or
// not emission has yet run, with `markdown` absent or `emit: false` no path
// is a destination, so the 13.4 exclusion and the import rule of 4 have no
// Markdown component.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-3/H-4):
// - 14.14 contract: `expectConfigurationError` (shared, ./support.ts) — exit
//   2 exactly, byte-empty stdout under --json, stderr matching /config/i.
// - T7.1-1 coverage: profiles are looked up by name (T8.2-1 owns report
//   ordering and the full report contract — counts and the ignored-node
//   composition are not asserted here); "sees it in both" is asserted as the
//   shared file's leaves appearing in each profile's covered/uncovered sets,
//   the covered node with its exact boundary-to-target path (the harness
//   information model, helpers/adapters/model.ts).
// - T7.1-1 policy findings are compared as sorted "rule :: kind: from -> to"
//   renderings: SPEC 7.5 fixes the information (rule name + offending edge),
//   not an order, and one finding per (rule, edge) pair.
// - T7.3-1 emitted Markdown is byte-asserted (SPEC 3 fixes the compiled
//   bytes; H-4); the compilation semantics themselves are T3-*'s subject —
//   fixture sources are single-section files with trivially known output.
// - T7.3-1 classification-follows-emit, discovery channel: 14.19 constrains
//   spec-group files to `.mdx` (7.1), but no extension rule constrains code
//   groups (14.19/14.20: any non-`.tsx` name parses as plain TypeScript), so
//   a destination path is staged as a *valid* code source — with `emit:
//   false` it must be discovered (its top-level marker's `references` edge
//   exists and `--from` knows the location), with `emit: true` it must not
//   (13.4 excludes destinations from every group). Whole-graph edge-set
//   equality has teeth because the fixture's complete edge set is spec-forced
//   (SPEC 5.1–5.2); the unknown-path `--from` probe uses T7-3's exit-2
//   operationalization (empty stdout, non-empty stderr diagnostic; 12.0).
// - T7.3-1 classification-follows-emit, import-rule channel (T4-2's rule,
//   SPEC 4/13.4/14.15): the identical workspace flips between exactly one
//   14.15 finding (`emit: true` — the specifier designates a configured
//   destination) and a clean build (`emit: false` — no path is a
//   destination, so the ordinary import is outside xspec's validations).
