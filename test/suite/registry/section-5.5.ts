// TEST-SPEC §5.5 (hashes) — SUITE-19: T5.5-1…T5.5-6.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 5.5: every requirement node has four hashes, deterministic for
// identical input. ownHash hashes the own content sequence of 1.6 — byte
// runs (empty runs included) alternating with node references, each
// reference entering as its target's canonical identity (5.4), child and
// embedding references distinguished. subtreeHash = hash(ownHash, child
// subtreeHashes in document order). effectiveHash = hash(ownHash, child
// effectiveHashes, the node's dependency edges as (canonical identity,
// effectiveHash) pairs sorted by canonical identity — one pair per EDGE, not
// per distinct target). metadataHash = hash(`d`-declared target set sorted
// the same way, coverage attribute, sorted tags).
//
// Hash values themselves are opaque: every assertion is a self-comparison —
// changed / byte-identical across a staged edit, or equal across identically
// staged inputs (H-4). Where SPEC.md fixes bytes (the 1.6/3 text values that
// anchor the line-drop-toggle arm), the expectation is the hand-derived byte
// string from the fixture's known source.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - "Repositioned between runs" (T5.5-2) is staged as the sharpest instance:
//   two embeddings of distinct targets exchange positions around
//   byte-identical runs, so the own-content byte runs and the reference
//   multiset are both unchanged and only the positions differ — a product
//   hashing references position-insensitively reports no change.
// - Impact entries follow the suite's fixed T1.5-1 interpretation (SPEC 9.3
//   groups output by category): "no change categories" is asserted as an
//   empty `requirements` list; the kind-distinction arm asserts its parent
//   carries `changed` in some non-deleted entry without pinning the 9.3
//   entry-collapsing conventions (SUITE-32's business).
// - T5.5-4's twin fixture asserts its stated precondition as a control: two
//   byte-identical dependency-free targets have equal effectiveHash
//   (deterministic hash of identical input, SPEC 5.5), so the retarget
//   comparison isolates the identity component of the target pairs.
