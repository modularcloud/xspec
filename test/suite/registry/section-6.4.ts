// TEST-SPEC §6.4 (rename) — SUITE-24: T6.4-1…T6.4-7.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 6.4: `xspec rename <file> <old-id> <new-id>` renames a requirement ID,
// rewrites descendant IDs by prefix replacement, rewrites every reference to
// the affected identities across all configured spec and code sources (`id`
// attributes, `d` references, `text(...)` references, TypeScript markers),
// and appends the mapping to the journal. Rewrites are minimal in-place
// edits, preserving each reference's quote style and access form (2.4); where
// a form cannot be kept, the rewritten part uses dot access for segments that
// are valid TypeScript identifiers, double-quoted computed access for
// segments that are not, and double-quoted string literals. Type-level
// references record no edges and are not rewritten. A nonexistent `<file>` or
// old ID is a usage error (12.0) checked before source validation, but an old
// ID inside an unparseable origin file is masked (14.20, 14); every other
// validation failure refuses the rename (exit 1), the valid-workspace
// precondition included, before modifying anything. A successful rename
// finishes by regenerating derived files exactly as `xspec build` does.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - T6.4-1 "all edges retarget (query-asserted)": the workspace-wide edge set
//   of each dependency kind (`query edges --kinds depends|embeds|references`)
//   is asserted exactly, before and after the rename; `contains` retargeting
//   is asserted through the full incoming/outgoing edge sets of the two
//   renamed nodes (`query node`), whose contains inventory the fixture pins
//   completely — the workspace-wide `contains` inventory (root edges
//   included) is §11's business, not this test's.
// - T6.4-1 "mapping appended to journal" uses the SUITE-21
//   operationalization: the journal (absent before the first journaled
//   operation, SPEC 6.1) exists as a plain file holding exactly one
//   line-oriented entry after the one rename; entry content stays opaque
//   (H-4).
// - T6.4-2 stages every *affected* reference part in dot access or
//   double-quoted form, so each expected byte is pinned whichever way 6.4's
//   preserve-then-default rule is read; single-quoted spellings appear only
//   in untouched parts and untouched references, whose byte-wise preservation
//   T6.4-2 pins explicitly. Whole rewritten source files are compared
//   byte-exactly ("only the affected parts change" pins all other bytes).
// - T6.4-3/T6.4-6 "modifies nothing" is a whole-workspace-root byte snapshot
//   compare around the refused command, with the pre-refusal `build`'s
//   derived files present — a product that rewrites before validating, or
//   regenerates on refusal, fails the compare. Refusal arms run with
//   `--json`: a refused operation's report is the form-exact 12.7
//   findings-only report (SPEC 12.7, H-3), and each arm — staged to isolate
//   one refusal cause — asserts exactly one finding carrying the exact
//   stable refusal code (SPEC 14: one finding per applicable reason,
//   TEST-SPEC preamble: a code is contract) with the concerned identity or
//   located bearer §14 assigns the reason (T14-7's staging record names
//   T6.4-3). Identity concerns accept the full 1.5 identity or its bare ID
//   (§14 requires identification, not spelling); the collision arm's window
//   spans the remaining colliding bearer's whole construct, admitting any
//   in-construct precision while rejecting wrong-construct attribution.
//   T6.4-6's invalid-workspace refusal instead reports the workspace's
//   numbered findings alone (SPEC 14, 6.4) — exactly its one 14.5 finding
//   located in the offending file, no refusal reason beside it.
// - T6.4-4 exit-2 arms run with `--json`: stdout exactly one 12.7 error
//   document (12.0: with JSON output in effect, an exit-2 invocation emits
//   the error document as its entire stdout — no report, no validation
//   findings: the 12.0-ordering discriminator) and the usage error message
//   on stderr (12.0), asserted for presence, not wording. The masking arm
//   asserts exit 1 with a findings report of exactly one 14.20 naming the
//   unparseable file with a location (SPEC 14, H-3).
// - T6.4-7 "byte-identical to a fresh build of the rewritten sources" is the
//   H-6 two-directory protocol: a second workspace is seeded with the
//   post-rename configuration, sources, and journal (derived files are
//   reproducible from sources, configuration, and the journal, SPEC 13.4),
//   `xspec build` runs there, and the two workspace roots are compared as
//   whole byte trees — generated modules, Markdown output, and graph data
//   all included, normalizing nothing.
