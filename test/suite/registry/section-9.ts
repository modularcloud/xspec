// TEST-SPEC §9 through §9.2 (impact analysis: baseline plumbing, requirement
// categories, impacted code) — SUITE-31: T9-1, T9.1-1, T9.2-1…T9.2-5.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// Impacted-code evaluation (SPEC 9.2) runs over the impact edges of a code
// location — the union of its `references` and `embeds` edges in the baseline
// graph and in the current graph, identities mapped through the journal
// (6.3) — and a node present on only one side, added or deleted, counts as
// one whose subtreeHash and effectiveHash changed. Baselines are committed
// git sources only (no build output at the ref; HARNESS-01: pinned identities
// and timestamps); the current side is the edited working tree, rebuilt
// (`build`, exit 0) before every `impact` run — the SUITE-20/22 protocol.
// Code locations here are whole files (SPEC 4.6): every marker and `text(...)`
// call sits at the top level of its `src/*.ts` file, enclosed by no named
// code unit.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - Impacted-code entries are asserted whole ({location, edge, path}) and
//   compared as sorted sets per group: SPEC 9.3 gives each impacted location
//   one entry per code category, and in every fixture here the qualifying
//   edge and its shortest witness path are unique, so the entry content is
//   spec-fixed; the order of entries within a group is not asserted (SPEC 9.3
//   fixes the grouping; T12.0-7 owns ordering determinism).
// - The witness edge is asserted with `from` equal to the reported location:
//   a location's impact edges are its own `references`/`embeds` edges
//   (SPEC 9.2), and the reported edge is the one targeting the chosen path's
//   first node (9.3), so it runs from the location itself.
// - Requirement-level entries are T9.1-1's and T5.6-*'s business; the T9.2-*
//   bodies assert the code groups only.
// - T9-1's no-difference arms assert the empty report through the suite's
//   fixed T1.5-1 convention (SPEC 9.3 groups output by category, so an
//   uncategorized node appears under none — `requirements` empty) plus empty
//   code groups. Its human (non-`--json`) runs assert exit 0 (impact is
//   informational, SPEC 9.3) and, with differences present, that the report
//   on stdout mentions the changed node's identity (12.0: reports are
//   standard-output content; H-3 robust matching, never wording).
//
// Sources staged after a body's first product invocation are staged-source
// records (helpers/staged-mdx.ts, S-9: judged before any product exists)
// or, for product-rewritten bytes, `workspace.edit()` after a diagnosed
// premise; every other staging precedes the body's first invocation, so
// S-7's sweep reaches it against the stub.
