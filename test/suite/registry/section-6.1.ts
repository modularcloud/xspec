// TEST-SPEC §6.1 (the journal) — SUITE-21: T6.1-1…T6.1-3.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), and rejects a product only via diagnosed
// assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 6.1: the journal is a plain-text, append-only file at `.xspec/journal`
// with one entry per line, written only by `rename` and `move`; absent file =
// empty journal, and the file comes into existence with the first journaled
// operation. It is durable (13.4): never modified or deleted by other
// commands. Entries are byte-deterministic for a given operation and
// workspace state; content is otherwise opaque — assertions here stick to the
// stated observable contract (line-oriented, append-only form; H-4).
//
// Staging constraint (CERTIFICATIONS.md §CONF-CORE — T6.1-1 and T6.1-2 are
// in-scope): their fixtures stay within CONF-CORE's scope — one configured
// spec group of `.mdx` sources without imports, embeddings, `d` props, or
// tags; no `code`, `markdown`, `coverage`, or `policy` keys; no git; the only
// mutating commands driven are `rename` and file-form `move`. In this
// git-less scope `impact --base` is the exit-2 unreadable-baseline case
// (SPEC 6.3, 12.0).
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - "One entry per line" + "the journal is written only by rename and move"
//   (SPEC 6.1) pin the line count: after N journaled operations the journal
//   holds exactly N lines. The line count tolerates both line conventions
//   (final line terminated or not); T6.1-1 asserts the count after every
//   operation, which realizes "appends exactly one line-oriented entry".
// - "Rewrites nothing above it" is asserted as: the prior journal bytes are
//   a strict byte prefix of the new journal bytes.
// - T6.1-3 "naming the line": entry content is opaque, so the harness accepts
//   any of — a location within the garbage line's byte window in
//   `.xspec/journal`, the message echoing the garbage line's text, or the
//   message citing line/entry 2 (`line 2`, `entry 2`, or a `journal:2`
//   file:line form). The garbage sits on line 2 (one legitimate entry
//   precedes it), so a finding pointing at line 1 or at the whole file
//   without naming the line fails — the discrimination the TEST-SPEC asks
//   for.
