// TEST-SPEC §6.5 (move) — SUITE-25: T6.5-1…T6.5-6.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 6.5: `xspec move <old-file> <new-file>` relocates a source file (IDs
// unchanged, identities change file part only, the moved file's own import
// specifiers and other files' imports of its generated module rewritten so
// everything resolves); `xspec move <file>#<id> <target-file>#<new-id>`
// extracts a section subtree, re-identified by prefix replacement, with exact
// text edits: the moved text is the construct's own characters (or the
// self-closing tag's own characters, 1.1); origin lines left empty or
// whitespace-only purely by the deletion are dropped with their terminators
// (rule of 3); insertion is immediately before the target parent's closing
// tag (end of file for a top-level `new-id`), followed by U+000A and preceded
// by one when the insertion point is not at the start of a line; a
// self-closing target parent is first rewritten to paired form; the target
// file is created when absent. Beyond these edits, the identity and reference
// rewrites, and the finishing regeneration, a move changes no bytes. All
// references are rewritten to resolve, converting between local and imported
// forms; imports are added binding fresh, non-colliding identifiers and
// removed exactly when a binding had references and the rewrite leaves it
// with none; the full mapping is appended to the journal in both forms;
// rewritten content is byte-deterministic. Validation mirrors rename (6.4) in
// identity terms, plus move-specific refusals; a nonexistent origin file or
// ID is a usage error (12.0).
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - T6.5-1 "rewritten so everything resolves": SPEC pins resolution, not the
//   rewritten specifier's spelling (several relative paths resolve to one
//   file), so specifiers are asserted as: the stale quoted spelling gone, a
//   spelling naming the moved module's file stem present (every resolving
//   specifier ends in `Moved.xspec` / `Other.xspec`), and `check` exit 0 —
//   which enforces that all imports and references actually resolve (12.2).
// - "Mapping appended to the journal" uses the SUITE-21 operationalization:
//   the journal (absent before the first journaled operation, SPEC 6.1) is a
//   plain file holding exactly one line-oriented entry after the one move;
//   entry content stays opaque (H-4). T6.5-1 asserts it for the file form,
//   T6.5-3 for the section form — "the full mapping … (6.5: both forms)".
// - T6.5-1/T6.5-3 "finishing regeneration as T6.4-7" is the H-6 two-directory
//   protocol: a second workspace is seeded with the post-move configuration,
//   sources, and journal (derived files are reproducible from those,
//   SPEC 13.4), `xspec build` runs there, and the two workspace roots are
//   compared as whole byte trees, normalizing nothing.
// - T6.5-2 compares every staged source file byte-exactly after the move; an
//   uninvolved bystander file in each arm witnesses "no other byte changes".
//   The finishing regeneration's derived files are deliberately outside these
//   compares (they are T6.5-1/T6.5-3's fresh-build business).
// - T6.5-3 identifier choice and placement for added imports are
//   deterministic per SPEC 6.5/6.1 but their concrete spelling is
//   product-chosen, so freshness/non-collision is asserted through the
//   observable contract: the target file already binds the identifier `Keep`
//   (to another module) that the added `./Keep.xspec` import would naturally
//   take, so a non-fresh choice becomes a duplicate binding (14.15) and fails
//   the post-move `check`; byte determinism itself is the H-6 two-directory
//   protocol over the whole move (rewritten sources, derived files, and
//   journal alike). Conversion spellings that 6.4's rules do pin — converted
//   references become double-quoted string literals, kept forms keep their
//   quote style — are asserted as exact substrings (`d={"tm"}`,
//   `{text("tm.k1")}`, `d={"tm.k1"}`).
// - T6.5-4 refusal report content is deliberately unasserted (12.0 classes
//   refusals exit 1; TEST-SPEC pins no report content), so refusal arms run
//   without `--json`; "modifies nothing" is a whole-workspace-root byte
//   snapshot compare around each refused command with the pre-refusal
//   `build`'s derived files present (the T6.4-3 protocol). Because each arm
//   proves it modified nothing, the arms share one staged workspace. The 6.5
//   destination clauses "containing `#`" and "not valid UTF-8" admit no
//   refusal staging (T6.5-4's dead-letter note): every operand spelling that
//   would present either is an exit-2 usage error before any refusal is
//   evaluated — those stagings are T6.5-5's.
// - T6.5-5 exit-2 arms run with `--json`: stdout exactly one 12.7 error
//   document (12.0: with JSON output in effect, an exit-2 invocation emits
//   the error document as its entire stdout — no report, no validation
//   findings: the 12.0-ordering discriminator) and the usage error message
//   on stderr (presence, not wording). The masking arm asserts exit 1 with
//   exactly one 14.20 finding naming the unparseable origin file. The two
//   stagings T6.5-4's dead-letter note sets aside are asserted here, each
//   with a whole-root modifies-nothing snapshot compare around the command:
//   a `#`-containing file-form destination — classified as a `<file>#<id>`
//   pair by spelling alone, so the invocation mixes the two synopses' forms
//   and matches neither (SPEC 6.5, 12.0) — and a non-UTF-8 destination
//   operand, a usage-error argument value (SPEC 12.0), staged on the Linux
//   leg only (mirroring T1.5-2's platform note): argv bytes exist as a
//   channel there, carried by the subprocess driver's raw-byte argv support.
// - T6.5-6's unstageable clauses are documented at the test, per TEST-SPEC:
//   the collision clause's after-the-removal qualifier admits no
//   discriminating fixture (structural IDs make the vacated set exactly the
//   moved subtree's IDs, so a `<new-id>` matching only vacated identities is
//   always independently refused), and the mirrored "all rewritten references
//   resolve" clause is unstageable for T6.4-3's reason.

//   user of its `Keep` binding, so that import goes.
// - unreferenced import stays: Target.mdx's `Keep` → `./Spare.xspec` binding
//   had no references before the move and must survive byte-verbatim.

// - The mirrored "all rewritten references resolve" clause, for T6.4-3's
//   reason: a move rewrites only valid workspaces and retargets every
//   affected reference to identities that exist after the operation; it is
//   exercised as the always-passing side of every successful move.
