// TEST-SPEC §5.4 (reference canonicalization) — SUITE-18: T5.4-1, T5.4-2.
//
// Registered product-facing bodies (C-2 "one code path"): each builds its own
// fresh workspace (H-1), drives the product strictly as a subprocess (H-2),
// asserts exact exit codes (H-5), decodes output through the H-3 adapters,
// and rejects a product only via diagnosed assertion failures (H-8).
//
// SPEC 5.4: references hash as their target's canonical identity — the
// identity a backwards journal walk ends on, PAIRED with the journal position
// where it ends — never as spellings. An identity vacated by a journaled
// rename/move and later re-borne (by manual authorship or by another
// journaled rename) therefore starts a new chain: distinct nodes always have
// distinct canonical identities, and references to them never hash alike,
// while the pure operations of 6.2 change no hash at all.
//
// Conservative operationalizations (noted per H-4):
// - Impact entries: an uncategorized, undeleted node has no requirement entry
//   (SPEC 9.3 groups output by category), the interpretation the suite fixed
//   in T1.5-1 (section-1.5.ts) — "reports no categories" is asserted as an
//   empty `requirements` list, "unchanged" as the absence of any entry naming
//   the node.
// - Manual-edit staging anchors on spec-mandated rewrite forms (SPEC 6.4:
//   minimal in-place edits preserving quote style and access form;
//   double-quoted computed access where a segment is no TypeScript
//   identifier; double-quoted string literals for references converted to
//   local form). A missing or ambiguous anchor fails diagnosed — a product
//   deviating from those mandated forms legitimately fails here.
// - T5.4-2's "changes no hash" manual arms compare all four hashes of every
//   node of the (deliberately small) fixture before and after the edit; the
//   rename/move arms compare the referencing node, per the test's text.
